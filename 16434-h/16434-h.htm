<center><h2><a name="page_vii"></a>PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN
EDITION.</h2></center>

<hr width="10%">

<p>It will be long before we have a biography of Froebel to compare with
DeGuimp's <i>Pestalozzi</i>, of which an English translation has just
appeared. Meantime we must content ourselves with two long
autobiographical letters contained in this volume, which, though
incomplete, have yet the peculiar charm that comes from the candid
record of genuine impressions.</p>

<p>The first of these letters, that to the Duke of Meiningen, has
already appeared in English, in a translation by Miss Lucy Wheelock for
Barnard's <i>American Journal of Education</i>, since reprinted in pp. 21-48
of his <i>Kindergarten and Child Culture</i>, (see <a href="#page_146">p.
146</a>), and in a small volume under the title <i>Autobiography of
Froebel</i> (see <a href="#page_146">p. 146</a>). While a faithful attempt
to reproduce the original, this translation struggled in vain to
transform Froebel's rugged and sometimes seemingly incoherent sentences
into adequate and attractive English, so that the long letter has proved
to most English readers formidable and repellant. But in the original it
is one of the most charming productions in literature, candid and
confidential in tone, and detailing those inner gropings for ideas that
became convictions which only an autobiography can reveal. These
qualities are so admirably preserved in the translation by Miss Emily
Michaelis and H. Keatley Moore that it seemed to leave nothing to be
desired. They have not only given a faithful rendering, but they have
impressed upon it the loving touch of faithful disciples. Accordingly I
purchased from the English publishers the American rights to this
translation; and have reproduced not only this <a name="page_viii"></a>
letter, but that to the philosopher Krause, with Barop's "Critical
Moments," and the "Chronological Abstract," all from duplicates of the
English plates.</p>

<p>The rest of the volume appears for the first time. The Bibliography
seemed desirable, and is confined to attainable books likely to be of
value to American teachers. The Index is full, but not fuller than the
fragmentary character of the material seemed to require. The Table of
Contents will also serve to make reference easy to the principal evens
of Froebel's history.</p>

<p>In the lives of Pestalozzi and of Froebel many resemblances may be
traced. Both were sons of clergymen. Both were half-orphans from their
earliest recollections. Both were unhappy in childhood, were
misunderstood, companionless, awkward, clumsy, ridiculed. Both were as
boys thrown into the almost exclusive society of women, and both
retained to the last strongly feminine characteristics. Both were
throughout life lacking in executive ability; both were financially
improvident. Both were dependent for what they did accomplish upon
friends, and both had the power of inspiring and retaining friendships
that were heroic, Pestalozzi's Krüsi corresponding with Froebel's
Middendorf. Both became teachers only by accident, and after failure in
other professions. Both saw repeated disaster in the schools they
established, and both were to their last days pointed at as visionary
theorists of unsound mind. Both failed to realize their ideas, but both
planted their ideas so deeply in the minds of others that they took
enduring root. Both lacked knowledge of men, but both knew and loved
children, and were happiest when personally and alone they had children
under their charge. Both delighted in nature, and found in solitary
contemplation of flowers and woods and mountains relief from the
disappointments they encountered among their fellows.</p>

<p><a name="page_ix"></a>But there were contrasts too. Pestalozzi had no
family ties, while Froebel maintained to the last the closest relations
with several brothers and their households. Pestalozzi married at
twenty-three a woman older than himself, on whom he thereafter relied in
all his troubles. Froebel deferred his marriage till thirty-six and then
seems to have regarded his wife more as an advantage to his school than
as a help-meet to himself.</p>

<p>Pestalozzi was diffident, and in dress and manner careless to the
point of slovenliness; Froebel was extravagant in his self-confidence,
and at times almost a dandy in attire. Pestalozzi was always honest and
candid, while Froebel was as a boy untruthful. Pestalozzi was touchingly
humble, and eager to ascribe the practical failure of his theories to
his personal inefficiency; Froebel never acknowledged himself in the
wrong, but always attributed failure to external causes. On the other
hand, while Froebel was equable in temperament, Pestalozzi was moody and
impressionable, flying from extreme gaiety to extreme dejection,
slamming the door if displeased with a lesson a teacher was giving, but
coming back to apologize if he met a child who smiled upon him. Under
Rousseau's influence Pestalozzi was inclined to skepticism, and limited
religious teaching in school to the reading of the gospels, and the
practice of Christianity; Froebel was deeply pious, and made it
fundamental that education should be founded plainly and avowedly upon
religion.</p>

<p>Intellectually the contrast is even stronger. While Froebel had a
university education, Pestalozzi was an eminently ignorant man; his
penmanship was almost illegible, he could not do simple sums in
multiplication, he could not sing, he could not draw, he wore out all
his handkerchiefs gathering pebbles and then never looked at them
afterward. Froebel was not only a reader but a scientific reader, always
seeking first to find out what <a name="page_x"></a> others had
discovered that he might begin where they left off; Pestalozzi boasted
that he had not read a book in forty years. Naturally, therefore,
Pestalozzi was always an experimenter, profiting by his failures but
always failing in his first attempts, and hitting upon his most
characteristic principles by accident; while Froebel was a theorist,
elaborating his ideas mentally before putting them in practice, and
never satisfied till he had properly located them in his general scheme
of philosophy.</p>

<p>And yet, curiously enough, it is Pestalozzi who was the author. His
"Leonard and Gertrude" was read by every cottage fireside, while
Froebel's writings were intelligible only to his disciples. Pestalozzi
had an exuberant imagination and delightful directness and simplicity of
expression; Froebel's style was labored and obscure, and his doctrines
may be better known through the "Child and Child Nature" of the Baroness
Marenholz von Buelow than through his own "Education of Man."</p>

<p>The account of Froebel's life given in this volume is supplemented
somewhat by the "Reminiscences" of this same Baroness, who became
acquainted with him in 1849, and was thereafter his most enthusiastic
and successful apostle. Till some adequate biography appears, that
volume and this must be relied upon for information of the man who
shares equally with Pestalozzi the honor of educational reform in this
century.</p>

<p>Und als er so, wie Wichard Lange richtig sagt, der Apostel des
weiblichen Gechlechts geworden war, starb er, der geniale, unermüdlich
thätige, von Liebe getragene Mann.&mdash;S<small>CHMIDT</small>,
<i>Geschichte der Pädagogik</i>, Cöthen, 1862, iv. 282.</p>

<p>En résumé, Rousseau aurait pu être déconcerté par les inventions
pratiques, un peu subtiles parfois, de l'ingénieux Froebel. Il eût
souri, comme tout le monde, des artifices par lesquels il obligeait
l'enfant à se faire acteur au milieu de ses petits camarades, à imiter
tour à tour le soldat qui monte la garde, le cordonnier qui travaille,
le cheval qui piétine, l'homme fatigué qui se repose. Mais, sur les
principes, il se serait mis aisément d'accord avec l'auteur de
<i>l'Education de l'homme</i>, avec un penseur à l'âme tendre et noble, qui
remplaçait les livres par les choses, qui à une instruction pédantesque
substituait l'éducation intérieure, qui aux connaissances positives
préférait la chaleur du sentiment, la vie intime et profonde de l'âme,
qui respectait la liberté et la spontanéité de l'enfant, qui enfin
s'efforçait d'écarter de lui les mauvaises influences et de faire à son
innocence un milieu digne d'elle&mdash;C<small>OMPAYRÉ</small>'s
<i>Histoire Critique des Doctrines de l'Éducation en France depuis le
XVIme Siécle</i>, Paris, 1879, ii. 125.</p>

<p>We might say that his effort in pedagogy consists chiefly in
organizing into a system the sense intuitions which Pestalozzi proposed
to the child somewhat at random and without direct
plan.&mdash;C<small>OMPAYRÉ</small>'s <i>History of Pedagogy</i>, Payne's
translation, Boston, 1886, p. 449.</p>

<p><a name="page_xii"></a>Er war gleich Pestalozzi von den höchsten
Ideen der Zeit getragen und suchte die Erziehung an diese Ideen
anzuknüpfen. So lange die Mutter nicht nach den Gesetzen der Natur ihr
Kind erzieht und bildet und dafür nicht ihr Leben einsetst, so
lange&mdash;davon geht er aus&mdash;sind alle Reformen der Schule auf
Sand gebaut. Trotsdem verlegt er einen Theil der mütterlichen Aufgabe in
den Kindergarten, in welchem er die Kinder vor ihre Schulpflichtigkeit
vereinigt wissen will, (1) um auf die häusliche Erziehung ergänzend und
verbessernd einzuwirken, (2) um das Kind aus dem Einzelleben heraus Zum
Verkehr mil seinesgleichen zu führen, und (3) um dem weiblichen
Geschlechte Gelegenheit zu geben, sich auf seinen erzieherischen Beruf
vorzubereiten.&mdash;B<small>ÖHM</small>'s <i>Kurzgefasste Geschichte der
Pädagogik</i>, Nürnberg, 1880, p. 134.</p>

<p>Le jardin d'enfants est évidemment en opposition avec l'idée
fondamentale de Pestalozzi; car celui-ci avait confié entièrement à la
mère et au foyer domestique la tâche que Froebel remet, en grande
partie, aux jardins d'enfants et à sa directrice. A l'égard des rapports
de l'éducation domestique, telle qui elle est à l'heure qu'il est, on
doit reconnaître que Froebel avait un coup-d'oeil plus juste que
Pestalozzi.&mdash;<i>Histoire d'Éducation</i>, F<small>REDERICK</small>
D<small>ITTES</small>, Redolfi's French translation, Paris, 1880, p.
258.</p>

<p>While others have taken to the work of education their own
pre-conceived notions of what that work should be, Froebel stands
consistently alone in seeking in the nature of the child the laws of
educational action&mdash;in ascertaining from the child himself how we
are to educate him.&mdash;J<small>OSEPH</small> P<small>AYNE</small>,
<i>Lectures on the Science and Art of Education</i>, Syracuse, 1885, p.
254.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, the celebrated Jahn (the "Father Jahn" of the
German gymnastics) told a Berlin student of a queer fellow he had met,
who made all sorts of wonderful things from stones and cobwebs. This
queer fellow <a name="page_xiii"></a> was Froebel; and the habit of
making out general truths from the observation of nature, especially
from plants and trees, dated from the solitary rambles in the
Forest.</p>

<p>As the cultivator creates nothing in the trees and plants, so the
educator creates nothing in the children,&mdash;he merely superintends
the development of inborn faculties. So far Froebel agrees with
Pestalozzi; but in one respect he was beyond him, and has thus become,
according to Michelet, the greatest of educational reformers. Pestalozzi
said that the faculties were developed by exercise. Froebel added that
the function of education was to develop the faculties by arousing
<i>voluntary activity</i>. Action proceeding from inner impulse
(<i>Selbsthäligkeit</i>) was the one thing needful, and here Froebel as usual
refers to God: "God's every thought is a work, a deed." As God is the
Creator, so must man be a creator also. Living acting,
conceiving,&mdash;these must form a triple cord within every child of
man, though the sound now of this string, now of that may preponderate,
and then again of two together.</p>

<p>Pestalozzi held that the child belonged to the family; Fichte on the
other hand, claimed it for society and the State. Froebel, whose mind,
like that of Frederick Maurice, delighted in harmonizing apparent
contradictions, and who taught that "all progress lay through opposites
to their reconciliations," maintained that the child belonged both to
the family and to society, and he would therefore have children spend
some hours of the day in a common life and in well-organized common
employments. These assemblies of children he would not call schools, for
the children in them ought not to be old enough for schooling. So he
invented the term <i>Kindergarten</i>, garden of children, and called the
superintendents "children's gardeners."&mdash;R.H. Q<small>UICK</small>,
in <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, xix edition.</p>

<center><h2><a name="page_001"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</h2></center>


<p>The year 1882 was the centenary of Froebel's birth, and in the
present "plentiful lack" of faithful translations of Froebel's own words
we proposed to the Froebel Society to issue a translation of the
"Education of Man," which we would undertake to make at our own cost,
that the occasion might be marked in a manner worthy of the English
branch of the Kindergarten movement. But various reasons prevented the
Society from accepting our offer, and the lamentable deficiency still
continues. We have therefore endeavoured to make a beginning by the
present work, consisting of Froebel's own words done into English as
faithfully as we know how to render them, and accompanied with any brief
explanation of our own that may be essential to the clear understanding
of the passages given. We have not attempted to rewrite our author, the
better to suit the practical, clear-headed, common-sense English
character, but have preferred simply to present him in an English dress
with his national and personal peculiarities untouched.</p>

<p>In so doing we are quite aware that we have sacrificed interest, for
in many passages, if not in most, a careful paraphrase of Froebel would
be much more intelligible and pithy to English readers than a true
rendering, since he probably possesses every fault of style except
over-conciseness; but we feel that it is better to let Froebel speak for
himself.</p>

<p>For the faithfulness of translation we hope our respective
nationalities may have stood us in good stead. We would, however, add
that a faithful translation is not a verbal translation. The translator
should rather strive to write each sentence as the author would have
written it in English.</p>

<p><a name="page_002"></a>Froebel's opinions, character, and work grow
so directly out of his life, that we feel the best of his writing that a
student of the Kindergarten system could begin with is the important
autobiographical "Letter to the Duke of Meiningen," written in the year
1827, but never completed, and in all probability never sent to the
sovereign whose name it bears. That this is the course Froebel would
himself have preferred will, we think, become quickly apparent to the
reader. Besides, in the boyhood and the earliest experiences of
Froebel's life, we find the sources of his whole educational system.
That other children might be better understood than he was, that other
children might have the means to live the true child-life that was
denied to himself, and that by their powers being directed into the
right channels, these children might become a blessing to themselves and
to others, was undoubtedly in great part the motive which induced
Froebel to describe so fully all the circumstances of his peculiar
childhood. We should undoubtedly have a clearer comprehension of many a
great reformer if he had taken the trouble to write out at length the
impressions of his life's dawn, as Froebel has done. In Froebel's
particular case, moreover, it is evident that although his account of
himself is unfinished, we fortunately possess all that is most important
for the understanding of the origin of the Kindergarten system. After
the "Letter to the Duke of Meiningen," we have placed the shorter
account of his life which Froebel included in a letter to the
philosopher Krause. A sketch of Barop's, which varies the point of view
by regarding the whole movement more in its outer aspect than even
Froebel himself is able to do, seemed to us also desirable to translate;
and finally we have added also a carefully prepared "chronology"
extended from Lange's list. Our translation is made from the edition of
Froebel's works published by Dr. Wichard Lange at Berlin in 1862.</p>

<center><h2><a name="page_003"></a>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FROEBEL.</h2>

<h4>(<small>A LETTER TO THE DUKE OF MEININGEN.</small>)</h4></center>


<p>I was born at Oberweissbach, a village in the Thuringian Forest, in
the small principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, on the 21st April,
1782. My father was the principal clergyman, or pastor, there.<a
href="#page_003_note_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (He died in 1802.) I was early
initiated into the conflict of life amidst painful and narrowing
circumstances; and ignorance of child-nature and insufficient education
wrought their influence upon me. Soon after my birth my mother's health
began to fail, and after nursing me nine months she died. This loss, a
hard blow to me, influenced the whole environment and development of my
being: I consider that my mother's death decided more or less the
external circumstances of my whole life.</p>

<p>The cure of five thousand souls, scattered over six or seven
villages, devolved solely on my father. This work, even to a man so
active as my father, who was very conscientious in the fulfilment of his
duty as minister, was all-absorbing; the more so since the custom of
frequent services still prevailed. Besides all this, my father had
undertaken to superintend the building of a large new church, which drew
him more and more from his home and from his children.</p>

<p>I was left to the care of the servants; but they, profiting by my
father's absorption in his work, left me, fortunately for me, to my
brothers, who were somewhat older than myself.<a
href="#page_003_note_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This, <a name="page_004"></a>
in addition to a circumstance of my later life, may have been the cause
of that unswerving love for my family, and especially for my brothers,
which has, to the present moment, been of the greatest importance to me
in the conduct of my life. Although my father, for a village pastor, was
unusually well informed&mdash;nay, even learned and
experienced&mdash;and was an incessantly active man, yet in consequence
of this separation from him during my earliest years I remained a
stranger to him throughout my life; and in this way I was as truly
without a father as without a mother. Amidst such surroundings I reached
my fourth year. My father then married again, and gave me a second
mother. My soul must have felt deeply at this time the want of a
mother's love,&mdash;of parental love,&mdash;for in this year occurs my
first consciousness of self. I remember that I received my new mother
overflowing with feelings of simple and faithful child-love towards her.
These sentiments made me happy, developed my nature, and strengthened
me, because they were kindly received and reciprocated by her. But this
happiness did not endure. Soon my step-mother rejoiced in the possession
of a son of her own;<a href="#page_004_note_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and then
her love was not only withdrawn entirely from me and transferred to her
own child, but I was treated with worse than indifference&mdash;by word
and deed, I was made to feel an utter stranger.</p>

<p>I am obliged here to mention these circumstances, and to describe
them so particularly, because in them I see the first cause of my early
habit of introspection, my tendency to self-examination, and my early
separation from companionship with other men. Soon after the birth of
her own son, when I had <a name="page_005"></a> scarcely entered my
boyhood, my step-mother ceased to use the sympathetic, heart-uniting
"thou" in speaking to me, and began to address me in the third person,
the most estranging of our forms of speech. And as in this mode of
address the third person, "he," isolates the person addressed, it
created a great chasm between my step-mother and me.<a
href="#page_005_note_4"><sup>4</sup></a> At the beginning of my boyhood,
I already felt utterly lonely, and my soul was filled with grief.</p>

<p>Some coarse-minded people wished to make use of my sentiments and my
mood at this time to set me against my step-mother, but my heart and
mind turned with indignation from these persons, whom I thenceforth
avoided, so far as I was able. Thus I became, at an early age, conscious
of a nobler, purer, inner-life, and laid the foundation of that proper
self-consciousness and moral pride which have accompanied me through
life. Temptations returned from time to time, and each time took a more
dangerous form: not only was I suspected as being capable of unworthy
things, but base conduct was actually charged against me, and this in
such a way as left no doubt of the impropriety of the suspicion and of
the untruthfulness of the accusation. So it came to pass that in the
first years of my boyhood I was perforce led to live to myself and in
myself&mdash;and indeed to study my own being and inner consciousness,
as opposed to external <a name="page_006"></a> circumstances. My inward
and my outward life were at that time, even during play and other
occupations, my principal subjects for reflection and thought.</p>

<p>A notable influence upon the development and formation of my
character was also exercised by the position of my parents' house. It
was closely surrounded by other buildings, walls, hedges, and fences,
and was further enclosed by an outer courtyard, a paddock, and a kitchen
garden. Beyond these latter I was strictly forbidden to pass. The
dwelling had no other outlook than on to the buildings to right and
left, the big church in front, and at the back the sloping fields
stretching up a high hill. For a long time I remained thus deprived of
any distant view: but above me I saw the sky, clear and bright as we so
often find it in the hill country; and around me I felt the pure fresh
breeze stirring. The impression which that clear sky and that pure air
then made on me has remained ever since present to my mind. My
perceptions were in this manner limited to only the nearest objects.
Nature, with the world of plants and flowers, so far as I was able to
see and understand her, early became an object of observation and
reflection to me. I soon helped my father in his favourite occupation of
gardening, and in this way received many permanent perceptions; but the
consciousness of the real life in nature only came to me further on, and
I shall return to the point hereafter in the course of my narrative. Our
domestic life at this time gave me much opportunity for occupation and
reflection. Many alterations went on in our house; both my parents were
exceedingly active-minded, fond of order, and determined to improve
their dwelling in every possible way. I had to help them according to my
capacity, and soon perceived that I thereby gained strength and
experience; while through this growth of strength and experience my own
games and occupations became of greater value to me.</p>

<p>But from my life in the open air amongst the objects of nature, and
from the externals of domestic life, I must now turn to the inner
aspects of my home and family.</p>

<p>My father was a theologian of the old school, who held knowledge and
science in less estimation than faith; but yet he endeavoured to keep
pace with the times. For this purpose he <a name="page_007"></a>
subscribed to the best periodicals he could obtain, and carefully
examined what information they offered him. This helped not a little to
elevate and enlighten the old-fashioned truly Christian life which
reigned in our family. Morning and evening all its members gathered
together, and even on Sunday as well, although on that day divine
service would of course also call upon us to assemble for common
religious worship. Zollikofer, Hermes, Marezoll, Sturm, and others,
turned our thoughts, in those delightful hours of heavenly meditation,
upon our innermost being, and served to quicken, unfold, and raise up
the life of the soul within us. Thus my life was early brought under the
influence of nature, of useful handiwork, and of religious feelings; or,
as I prefer to say, the primitive and natural inclinations of every
human being were even in my case also tenderly fostered in the germ. I
must mention here, with reference to my ideas regarding the nature of
man, to be treated of later, and as throwing light upon my professional
and individual work, that at this time I used repeatedly, and with deep
emotion, to resolve to try and be a good and brave man. As I have heard
since, this firm inward resolution of mine was in flagrant contrast with
my outward life. I was full of youthful energy and in high spirits, and
did not always know how properly to moderate my vivacity. Through my
want of restraint I got into all kinds of scrapes. Often, in my
thoughtlessness, I would destroy the things I saw around me, in the
endeavour to investigate and understand them.</p>

<p>My father was prevented by his manifold occupations from himself
instructing me. Besides, he lost all further inclination to teach me,
after the great trouble he found in teaching me to read&mdash;an art
which came to me with great difficulty. As soon as I could read,
therefore, I was sent to the public village school.</p>

<p>The position in which my father stood to the village schoolmasters,
that is to say, to the Cantor,<a
href="#page_007_note_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and to the master of the girls'
school, and his judgment of the value of their respective <a
name="page_008"></a> teaching, decided him to send me to the latter.
This choice had a remarkable influence on the development of my inner
nature, on account of the perfect neatness, quiet, intelligence, and
order which reigned in the school; nay, I may go further, and say the
school was exactly suitable for such a child as I was. In proof of this
I will describe my entrance into the school. At that time church and
school generally stood in strict mutual relationship, and so it was in
our case. The school children had their special places in church; and
not only were they obliged to attend church, but each child had to
repeat to the teacher, at a special class held for the purpose every
Monday, some passage of Scripture used by the minister in his sermon of
the day before, as a proof of attention to the service. From these
passages that one which seemed most suitable to children was then chosen
for the little ones to master or to learn by heart, and for that purpose
one of the bigger children had during the whole week, at certain times
each day, to repeat the passage to the little children, sentence by
sentence. The little ones, all standing up, had then to repeat the text
sentence by sentence in like manner, until it was thoroughly imprinted
on their memories.</p>

<p>I came into school on a Monday. The passage chosen for that week was,
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God." I heard these words every day in the
calm, serious, somewhat sing-song voices of the children, sometimes
repeated by one child, sometimes by the whole number. And the text made
an impression upon me such as none had ever done before and none ever
did after. Indeed, this impression was so vigorous and permanent, that
to this day every word spoken, with the special tone and expression then
given to it, is still vivid in my mind. And yet that is now nearly forty
years ago! Perhaps even then the simple boy's heart felt that these
words would be the foundation and the salvation of his life, bringing to
him that conviction which was to become later on to the working and
striving man a source of unconquerable courage, of unflinching,
ever-ready, and cheerful self-sacrifice. In short, my introduction into
that school was my birth into the higher spiritual life.</p>

<p>Here I break off my narrative to ask myself whether I dare venture to
pause yet a little longer over this first period of my <a
name="page_009"></a> life. But this was the time when the buds began to
unfold on my tree of life; this was the time when my heart found its
pivot-point, and when first my inner life awoke. If, then, I succeed in
giving an exact description of my early boyhood, I shall have provided
an important aid to the right understanding of my life and work as a
man. For that reason I venture to dwell at some inordinate length on
this part of my life, and the more willingly since I can pass more
quickly over later periods.</p>

<p>It often suggests itself to me, while thus reviewing and describing
my life, just as it does with teaching and education&mdash;namely, that
those things which are by most men thrown aside as common and
unimportant are the very things which are, as I take it, of weightiest
import. In my eyes, it is always a mistake to leave a gap in the
rudimentary and fundamental part of a subject. Still I know one may
exhaust the patience of a reader by touching on every minute detail,
before he has been permitted to glance at the whole picture and to
gather its scope and object. Therefore I beg your Highness<a
href="#page_009_note_6"><sup>6</sup></a> to pass over, at all events on
the first reading, anything that may appear too long and too
detailed.</p>

<p>Against standing rules, I was received in the girls' school, on
account of the position of my father as pastor of the district. For the
same reason I was placed, not with the pupils of my own age, but close
to the teacher, which brought me among the elder girls. I joined in
their lessons as far as I could. In two subjects I was quite able to do
this. First, I could read the Bible with them; and, secondly, I had to
learn line by line, instead of the little texts of the younger children
already spoken of, the hymns for the following Sunday's service. Of
these, two especially light up the gloomy lowering dawn of my early
boyhood, like two brilliant stars. They are&mdash;"Schwing dich auf,
mein Herz und Geist," and "Es kostet viel ein Christ zu sein."<a
href="#page_009_note_7"><sup>7</sup></a> These hymns were hymns of life
to me. I found my own little life expressed <a name="page_010"></a>
therein; and they took such a hold upon me that often in later years I
have found strength and support in the message which they carried to my
soul. My father's home life was in complete harmony with this discipline
of the school. Although divine service was held twice on Sundays, I was
but very seldom allowed to miss attending each service. I followed my
father's sermons with great attention, partly because I thought I found
in them many allusions to his own position, profession, and life.
Looking back, I consider it of no slight importance that I used to hear
the service from the vestry, because I was there separated from the
congregation, and could the better keep my attention from wandering.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that my father belonged to the old orthodox
school of theology; and in consequence the language both of his hymns
and of his sermons was mystical and symbolic&mdash;a style of speech
which, in more than one sense, I should call a stone-language, because
it requires an overwhelming power to burst its walls, and free from this
outer shell the life contained within. But what the full strength of
later life seems too weak to attain, is often accomplished by the
living, life-awakening, and life-giving power of some simple, thoughtful
young soul, by some young spirit first unfolding its wings, busily
seeking everywhere for the causes and connections of all things. Even
for such a youth, the treasure is to be gained only after long
examination, inquiry, and reflection. If ever I found that for which I
so longingly sought, then was I filled with exceeding joy.</p>

<p>The surroundings amidst which I had grown up, especially those in
which my first childhood was passed, had caused my senses to be much and
early exercised. The pleasures of the senses were from the first,
therefore, an object for the closest consideration with me. The results
of this analysing and questioning habit of my early boyhood were
perfectly clear and decisive, and, if not rendered into words, were yet
firmly settled in my mind. I recognised that the transitory pleasures of
the senses were without enduring and satisfying influence on man, and
that they were therefore on no account to be pursued with too great
eagerness. This conviction stamped and determined my whole being, just
as my questioning examination and comparison of the <a
name="page_011"></a> inner with the outer world, and my study of their
inter-connection, is now the basis of my whole future life. Unceasing
self-contemplation, self-analysis, and self-education have been the
fundamental characteristics of my life from the very first, and have
remained so until these latest days.</p>

<p>To stir up, to animate, to awaken, and to strengthen, the pleasure
and power of the human being to labour uninterruptedly at his own
education, has become and always remained the fundamental principle and
aim of my educational work.</p>

<p>Great was my joy when I believed I had proved completely to my own
satisfaction that I was not destined to go to hell. The stony,
oppressive dogmas of orthodox theology I very early explained away,
perhaps assisted in this by two circumstances. Firstly, I heard these
expressions used over and over again, from my habit of being present at
the lessons given by my father in our own house, in preparation for
confirmation. I heard them used also in all sorts of ways, so that my
mind almost unconsciously constructed some sort of explanation of them.
Secondly, I was often a mute witness of the strict way in which my
father performed his pastoral duties, and of the frequent scenes between
him and the many people who came to the parsonage to seek advice and
consolation. I was thus again constantly attracted from the outer to the
inner aspects of life. Life, with its inmost motives laid bare, passed
before my eyes, with my father's comments pronounced upon it; and thing
and word, act and symbol were thus perceived by me in their most vivid
relationship. I saw the disjointed, heavy-laden, torn, inharmonious life
of man as it appeared in this community of five thousand souls, before
the watchful eyes of its earnest, severe pastor. Matrimonial and sexual
circumstances especially were often the objects of my father's gravest
condemnation and rebuke. The way in which he spoke about these matters
showed me that they formed one of the most oppressive and difficult
parts of human conduct; and, in my youth and innocence, I felt a deep
pain and sorrow that man alone, among all creatures, should be doomed to
these separations of sex, whereby the right path was made so difficult
for him to find. I felt it a real necessity for the satisfaction of <a
name="page_012"></a> my heart and mind to reconcile this difficulty,
and yet could find no way to do so. How could I at that age, and in my
position? But my eldest brother, who, like all my elder brothers, lived
away from home, came to stay with us for a time; and one day, when I
expressed my delight at seeing the purple threads of the hazel buds, he
made me aware of a similar sexual difference in plants. Now was my
spirit at rest. I recognised that what had so weighed upon me was an
institution spread over all nature, to which even the silent, beautiful
race of flowers was submitted. From that time humanity and nature, the
life of the soul and the life of the flower, were closely knit together
in my mind; and I can still see my hazel buds, like angels, opening for
me the great God's temple of Nature.</p>

<p>I now had what I needed: to the Church was added the Nature-Temple;
to the religious Christian life, the life of Nature; to the passionate
discord of human life the tranquil peace of the life of plants. From
that time it was as if I held the clue of Ariadne to guide me through
the labyrinth of life. An intimate communion with Nature for more than
thirty years (although, indeed, often interrupted, sometimes for long
intervals) has taught me that plants, especially trees, are a mirror, or
rather a symbol, of human life in its highest spiritual relations; and I
think one of the grandest and deepest fore-feelings that have ever
emanated from the human soul, is before us when we read, in the Holy
Scriptures, of a tree of knowledge of good and evil. The whole of Nature
teaches us to distinguish good from evil; even the world of crystals and
stones&mdash;though not so vividly, calmly, clearly, and manifestly as
the world of plants and flowers. I said my hazel buds gave me the clue
of Ariadne. Many things grew clear to me: for instance, the earliest
life and actions of our first parents in Paradise, and much connected
therewith.</p>

<p>There are yet three points touching my inner life up to my tenth
year, which, before I resume the narrative of my outer life, I should
like to mention here.</p>

<p>The folly, superstition, and ignorance of men had dared to assume
then, as they have done lately, that the world would soon come to an
end. My mind, however, remained perfectly tranquil, because I reasoned
thus with myself firmly and definitely:&mdash;Mankind <a
name="page_013"></a> will not pass from the world, nor will the world
itself pass away, until the human race has attained to that degree of
perfection of which it is capable on earth. The earth, Nature in its
narrowest sense, will not pass away, moreover, until men have attained a
perfect insight into its essence. This idea has returned to me during my
life in many a varied guise, and I have often been indebted to its
influence for peace, firmness, perseverance, and courage.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this epoch, my eldest brother, already spoken of,
was at the university, and studied theology.<a
href="#page_013_note_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Philosophic criticism was then
beginning to elucidate certain Church dogmas. It was therefore not very
surprising that father and son often differed in opinion. I remember
that one day they had a violent dispute about religion and Church
matters. My father stormed, and absolutely declined to yield; my
brother, though naturally of a mild disposition, flushed deep-red with
excitement; and he, too, could not abandon what he had recognised as
true. I was present also on this as on many other occasions, an
unobserved witness, and can still see father and son standing face to
face in the conflict of opinion. I almost thought I understood something
of the subject in dispute; I felt as if I must side with my brother, but
there seemed at the same time something in my father's view which
indicated the possibility of a mutual understanding. Already I felt in a
dim way that every illusion has a true side, which often leads men to
cling to it with a desperate firmness. This conviction has become more
and more confirmed in me the longer I have lived; and when at any time I
have heard two men disputing for the truth's sake, I have found that the
truth is usually to be learnt from both sides. Therefore I have never
liked to take sides; a fortunate thing for me.<a
href="#page_013_note_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Another youthful experience which also had a decided influence in
forming my cast of character, was the following:&mdash;There are certain
oft-repeated demands made upon the members of our <a
name="page_014"></a> Established Church; such as, to enter upon the
service of Christ, to show forth Christ in one's life, to follow Jesus,
etc. These injunctions were brought home to me times without number
through the zeal of my father as a teacher of others and a liver himself
of a Christian life. When demands are made on a child which are in
harmony with child nature, he knows no reluctance in fulfilling them;
and as he receives them entirely and unreservedly, so also he complies
with them entirely and unreservedly. That these demands were so often
repeated convinced me of their intense importance; but I felt at the
same time the difficulty, or indeed, as it seemed to me, the
impossibility of fulfilling them. The inherent contradiction which I
seemed to perceive herein threw me into great depression; but at last I
arrived at the blessed conviction that human nature is such that it is
not impossible for man to live the life of Jesus in its purity, and to
show it forth to the world, if he will only take the right way towards
it.</p>

<p>This thought, which, as often as it comes into my mind, carries me
back even now to the scenes and surroundings of my boyhood, may have
been not improbably amongst the last mental impressions of this period,
and it may fitly close, therefore, the narrative of my mental
development at this age. It became, later, the point whereon my whole
life hinged.</p>

<p>From what I have said of my boyish inner life, it might be assumed
that my outer life was a happy and peaceful one. Such an assumption
would, however, not be correct. It seems as if it had always been my
fate to represent and combine the hardest and sharpest contrasts. My
outer life was really in complete contrast with my inner. I had grown up
without a mother; my physical education had been neglected, and in
consequence I had acquired many a bad habit. I always liked to be doing
something or another, but in my clumsy way I made mistakes as to choice
of materials, of time, and of place, and thus often incurred the severe
displeasure of my parents. I felt this, being of a sensitive
disposition, more keenly and more persistently than my parents; the more
so as I felt myself generally to blame in form rather than in substance,
and in my inmost heart I could see there was a point of view from whence
my conduct would seem, in substance <a name="page_015"></a> at all
events, not altogether wrong, still less blameworthy. The motives
assigned to my actions were not those which actuated me, so far as I
could tell; and the consciousness of being misjudged made me really what
I had been believed to be before, a thoroughly naughty boy. Out of fear
of punishment I hid even the most harmless actions, and when I was
questioned I made untruthful answers.</p>

<p>In short, I was set down as wicked, and my father, who had not always
time to investigate the justice of the accusations against me,
remembered only the facts as they were represented to him. My neglected
childhood called forth the ridicule of others; when playing with my
step-brother, I was always, according to my mother, the cause of
anything that went wrong. As the mind of my parents turned more and more
away from me, so on my side my life became more and more separated from
theirs; and I was abandoned to the society of people who, if my
disposition had not been so thoroughly healthy, might have injured me
even more than they did. I longed to escape from this unhappy state of
things; and I considered my elder brothers fortunate in being all of
them away from home. Just at this melancholy time came home my eldest
brother. He appeared to me as an angel of deliverance, for he recognised
amidst my many faults my better nature, and protected me against
ill-treatment. He went away again after a short stay; but I felt that my
soul was linked to his, thenceforth, down to its inmost depths; and
indeed, after his death, this love of mine for him turned the whole
course of my life.<a href="#page_015_note_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The boon was at last vouchsafed me, and that at my greatest need, to
leave my father's house. Had it been otherwise, the flagrant
contradiction between my outer and inner life must necessarily have
developed the evil inclinations which had begun in earnest to fasten
upon me. A new life entirely different from the former now opened before
me. I was ten years and nine months old. But I pause yet another moment
in the contemplation <a name="page_016"></a> of this period before I
pass to its narration. In order to be clearly understood by your serene
Highness, which is very necessary to me if I am to attain my object, I
will compare, with your permission, my former life with my present. I
shall endeavour to show how I trace the connection of my earlier and my
later life; how my earlier life has proved for me the means of
understanding my later; how, in general, my own individual life has
become to me a key to the universal life, or, in short, to what I call
the symbolic life and the perpetual, conditioned, and unbroken chain of
existence.</p>

<p>Since, throughout the period which I have just described, my inner
self, my life and being, my desires and endeavours, were not discerned
by my parents, so is it with me now with regard to certain German
Governments.<a href="#page_016_note_11"><sup>11</sup></a> And just as my
outward life then was imperfect and incomplete, through which
incompleteness my inner life was misunderstood, so also now the
imperfection and incompleteness of my establishment prevent people from
discerning the true nature, the basis, the source, the aim and purpose,
of my desires and endeavours, and from promoting them, after recognising
their value, in a right princely and patriotic spirit.</p>

<p>The misapprehension, the oppression under which I suffered in my
early years, prepared me to bear similar evils later on, and especially
those which weigh upon me in the present circumstances of my life. And
as I see my present private and public life and my destiny reflected in
a part of my former life, just so do I read and trace the present
universal life in my former individual life. Moreover, in the same way
as I tried as child or boy to educate myself to be a worthy man
according to those laws which God had implanted, unknown to me, within
my nature, so now do I strive in the same way, according to the same
laws, and <a name="page_017"></a> by the same method, to educate the
children of my country. That for which I strove as a boy, not yet
conscious of any purpose; the human race now strives for with equal
unconsciousness of purpose, but for all that none the less truly. The
race is, however, surrounded by less favourable circumstances than those
which influenced me in my boyhood.</p>

<p>Life in its great as well as in its small aspects, in humanity and
the human race as well as in the individual (even though the individual
man often wilfully mars his own existence)&mdash;life, in the present,
the past, and the future, has always appeared to me as a great undivided
whole, in which one thing is explained, is justified, is conditioned and
urged forward by the other.</p>

<p>In order that, if it be possible, there should remain no obscurity
whatever in my actions, thoughts, and life, I shall proceed to consider
them all, down to the very latest event which has happened to me; that
is, the writing-down of this statement of my life for your Highness. My
life experience it is which urges me to do this; not any whim or
caprice. Common worldly wisdom would challenge such a step if it were
known; no one would desire to take it, no one would dare to take it. I
dare it, and I do it, because my childhood has taught me that where for
trust we find distrust, where for union we find division, where for
belief we find doubt, there but sad fruit will come to the harvest, and
a burdensome and narrow life alone can follow.</p>

<p>I return again to the narrative of the development of my inner and
outer life.</p>

<p>A new existence now began for me, entirely opposed to that which I
had hitherto led. An uncle on my mother's side came to visit us in this
year; he was a gentle, affectionate man.<a
href="#page_017_note_12"><sup>12</sup></a> His appearance among us made
a most agreeable impression upon me. This uncle, being a man of
experience, may have noticed the adverse influences which surrounded me;
for soon after his departure he begged my father by letter to turn me
over to him entirely. My father readily consented, and towards the end
of <a name="page_018"></a> the year 1792 I went to him. He had early
lost both wife and child, and only his aged mother-in-law lived in his
house with him. In my father's house severity reigned supreme; here, on
the contrary, mildness and kindness held sway. There I encountered
mistrust; here I was trusted. There I was under restraint; here I had
liberty. Hitherto I had hardly ever been with boys of my own age; here I
found forty schoolfellows, for I joined the upper class of the town
school.<a href="#page_018_note_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The little town of Stadt-Ilm is situated in a somewhat wide valley,
and on the banks of a small limpid stream.<a
href="#page_018_note_14"><sup>14</sup></a> My uncle's house had gardens
attached, into which I could go if I liked; but I was also at liberty to
roam all over the neighbourhood, if only I obeyed the strict rule of the
house to return punctually at the time appointed. Here I drank in fresh
life-energy in long draughts; for now the whole place was my playground,
whereas formerly, at home, I had been limited to our own walls. I gained
freedom of soul and strength of body.</p>

<p>The clergyman who taught us never interfered with our games, played
at certain appointed playgrounds, and always with great fun and spirit.
Deeply humiliating to me were the frequent slights I received in our
play, arising from my being behind boys of my age in bodily strength,
and more especially in agility; and all my dash and daring could not
replace the robust, steady strength, and the confident sureness of aim
which my companions possessed. Happy fellows! they had grown up in
continual exercise of their youthful boyish strength. I felt myself
exceedingly fortunate when I had at length got so far that my
schoolfellows could tolerate me as a companion in their games. But
whatever I accomplished in this respect by practice, by continual effort
of will, and by the natural course of life, I always felt myself
physically deficient in contrast with their uncramped boyish powers.
Setting aside that which I had been robbed of by my previous education,
my new <a name="page_019"></a> life was vigorous and unfettered by
external restraint; and they tell me I made good use of my opportunity.
The world lay open before me, as far as I could grasp it. It may indeed
be because my present life was as free and unconstrained as my former
life had been cramped and constrained, anyhow the companions of my youth
have reminded me of several incidents of that time which make me think
that my good spirits led me to the borders of wildness and extravagance;
although as a boy I considered my demeanour quieter by far than that of
my companions of my own age. My communion with Nature, silent hitherto,
now became freer and more animated. And as, at the same time, my uncle's
house was full of peace and quiet contemplation, I was able as I grew up
to develop that side of my character also; thus on every side my life
became harmoniously balanced.</p>

<p>In two places, alike centres of education, I found myself as before
quite at home, even though I was more frequently than ever the victim of
absence of mind&mdash;I mean the church and the school. In the latter I
especially enjoyed the hours devoted to religious instruction. As with
my uncle himself, and with his life, so was it also with his sermons;
they were gentle, mild, and full of lovingkindness. I could follow them
quite readily, and in the Monday repetition at school I was able to give
a good account of them. But the religious instruction of our own
school-teacher responded best to my needs; all that I had worked out for
myself was placed by him in a fuller light, and received from him a
higher confirmation. Later in life, when I had grown to manhood, I spoke
with my uncle on the excellence of this teaching, and he made reply that
it was indeed very good, but was too philosophical and abstruse for
those to whom it was addressed; "for thee," continued he, "it may have
been well suited, since thou hadst already received such unusually good
instruction from thy father." Let that be as it may, this teaching
enlightened, animated, and warmed me,&mdash;nay, glowed within me till
my heart was completely melted, especially when it touched upon the
life, the work, and the character of Jesus. At this I would burst into
tears, and the longings to lead in future a similar life took definite
form, and wholly filled my soul. When I now hear tales of the
ebullitions of my youthful spirit occurring <a name="page_020"></a> in
that period of my life, I cannot help thinking that they must have led
superficial observers to the erroneous opinion that the monitions and
teachings of religion swept over my spirit without leaving a trace of
their passage. And yet how wrongly would such observers have judged the
true state of my inner life!</p>

<p>The subjects best taught in the school of Stadt-Ilm were reading,
writing, arithmetic, and religion. Latin was miserably taught, and still
worse learnt. Here, as in so many similar schools, the teaching utterly
lacked the elucidation of first principles. The time spent on Latin was
therefore not wasted upon me, in so far that I learnt from it that such
a method of teaching could bear no fruit among the scholars. Arithmetic
was a very favourite study of mine; and as I also received private
tuition in this subject, my progress was so rapid that I came to equal
my teacher both in theory and practice, although his attainments were by
no means despicable. But how astonished was I when, in my twenty-third
year, I first went to Yverdon, and found I could not solve the questions
there being set to the scholars! This was one of the experiences which
prepossessed me so keenly in favour of Pestalozzi's method of teaching,
and decided me to begin arithmetic myself from the very beginning over
again, according to his system. But more of this later.</p>

<p>In physical geography we repeated our tasks parrot-wise, speaking
much and knowing nothing; for the teaching on this subject had not the
very least connection with real life, nor had it any actuality for us,
although at the same time we could rightly name our little specks and
patches of colour on the map. I received private tuition in this subject
also. My teacher wished to advance further with me; he took me to
England. I could find no connection between that country and the place
and country in which I dwelt myself, so that of this instruction also I
retained but little. As for actual instruction in German, it was not to
be thought of; but we received directions in letter-writing and in
spelling. I do not know with what study the teaching of spelling was
connected, but I think it was not connected with any; it hovered in the
air. I had lessons, furthermore, in singing and in pianoforte playing,
but without result. I merely mention all this now, in order to be able
to refer to it later on.</p>

<p><a name="page_021"></a>My life the whole time of my stay with my
uncle had three aspects: the religious life developing and building up
my moral being; the external life made up of boyish play, into which I
threw my whole energy; and the life of thought quietly showing itself
within my uncle's peaceful home. To this last influence also I yielded
myself with equal earnestness, and felt no suspicion of the apparent
contradiction which my outward life exhibited to such a mood. Like my
school-fellows, I lived without control; as far as I saw or felt, I was
untrammelled; and yet I do not call to mind that any of us ever
committed a seriously culpable action.</p>

<p>Here I am obliged to mention something which as an educationist I can
by no means pass lightly by. We received instruction from two
schoolmasters: one was pedantic and rigid; the other, more especially
our class-teacher (<i>conrector</i>), was large-hearted and free. The first
never had any influence over his class; the second could do whatever he
pleased with us, and if he had but set his mind to it, or perhaps if he
had been aware of his power, he might have done some thoroughly good
sound work with his class. In the little town of Stadt-Ilm were two
ministers, both ephors<a href="#page_021_note_15"><sup>15</sup></a> of
the school. My uncle, the principal minister, was mild, gentle, and
kind-hearted, impressive in daily life as in his sacred office or in the
pulpit; the other minister was rigid even to sternness, frequently
scolding and ordering us about. The first led us with a glance. A word
from him, and surely few were so brutish as to refuse that word
admittance to their heart. The long exhortations of the other went, for
the most part, over our heads, leaving no trace behind. Like my father,
my uncle was a true shepherd of his flock; but a gentle lovingkindness
to all mankind reigned in him. My father was moved by the conviction of
the rectitude of his actions; he was earnest and severe. Both have been
dead over twenty years; but how different is the spirit they have left
behind amongst their congregations. Here, they are glad at being
released from so strict a control, and, if I am rightly informed,
unbridled license <a name="page_022"></a> has sprung up amongst them;
there, the little town raises itself to higher and ever higher
prosperity, and all things are made to serve towards mental culture, as
well as towards a right citizen-like business activity. I permit myself
this digression, because these results were paralleled as a
life-experience in my own life.</p>

<p>In this manner I lived, up to my confirmation; all but a few weeks,
that is, which I spent at my parents' house during the long holidays.
Here, too, everything seemed to take a gentler turn, and the domestic,
thrifty activity which filled the place, and always struck me anew in my
periodical visits home, wrought upon me with most beneficial effect. The
copper-plate engravings in my father's library were the first things I
sought out, especially those representing scenes in the history of the
world. A table showing our (German) alphabet in its relations with many
others made a surprising impression upon me. It enabled me to recognise
the connection and the derivation of our letters from the old
Ph&oelig;nician characters. This gave me a dim conception of the inner
connection of all those languages of which, as my brother had studied
and was still studying them, I often heard, and saw in print. Especially
the Greek language lost much of its strangeness in my eyes, now that I
could recognise its characters in the German alphabet. All this,
however, had no immediate consequence in my life; these things, as
echoes from my youth, produced their effect upon me at a later time.</p>

<p>At this time, too, I read all sorts of boys' books. The story of
Samuel Lawill impressed me most vividly; I, too, longed for such a ring,
which by its warning pressure on my finger could hinder my hand from
effecting unworthy purposes, and I was very angry with the youthful
owner of the ring in the story, who threw it away in irritation because
it pressed him right hard at a moment when he wished to commit a
passionate deed.<a href="#page_022_note_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>My confirmation, and the preparation for it, all conducted by <a
name="page_023"></a> my uncle, was over. I had received from it the most
impressive and the most far-reaching influence in my whole life, and all
my life-threads found in it their point of union and repose. I had now
to be prepared for some business calling, and the question was raised,
for which? That I should not study at the university had already been
decided long before by the express determination of my step-mother. For
since two of my brothers<a href="#page_023_note_17"><sup>17</sup></a>
had devoted themselves to study, she feared that the further additional
expense would be too heavy a burden upon my father's means. It may be
that this intention had already influenced and limited my whole course
of instruction; and probably only the little narrow circle of future
business aims had been considered; the eye had not looked upon the boy
as a future man. Possibly from this cause I was kept so little to Latin;
it was enough if I learnt, as our mode of expression ran, to "state a
<i>Casus</i>" (that is, to decline a noun). From my own experience it was
thus shown to me how eminently injurious it is in education and in
instruction to consider only a certain circle of future activities or a
certain rank in life. The wearisome old-fashioned education <i>ad hoc</i>
(that is, for some one special purpose) has always left many a noble
power of man's nature unawakened.</p>

<p>A career in our country frequently chosen by the worthiest and most
anxious parents for their sons is that of a post in the Treasury and
Exchequer. Aspirants to such a post have two means of entering and two
starting-points in this career; either they become a clerk to one of the
minor officials in the Treasury or Exchequer, or the personal servant of
one of the highest officials. As my knowledge of writing and figures
seemed to my father satisfactory and sufficient for such a post, and as
he knew well that it might lead, not merely to a life free from
pecuniary cares, but even to wealth and fortune, he chose this career as
mine. But the minor Treasury official who might have found employment
for such a young man, showed various reasons why he could not or would
not as yet receive me as a clerk. There was something in my nature which
revolted against the second mode I have mentioned of entering this
career; something which I never afterwards experienced, but which at the
time absolutely <a name="page_024"></a> prevented me from choosing such
a mode of starting in my future profession, and that in spite of the
most alluring hopes that were held out to me. My father meant well and
honestly by me, but fate ruled it against him. Strangely enough, it
happened that in my later capacity of schoolmaster, I became the
educator and teacher of two of the nephews of that very man into whose
service my father had meant to have sent me; and I hope to God that I
have been of greater service to that family by filling the heart and
brain of these young people with good and useful notions than if I had
brushed the clothes and shoes of their uncle, and spread his table with
savoury dishes. In the latter case, very likely an externally easy and
happy existence might have been mine, whereas now I wage a constant
fight with cares and difficulties.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, this career was closed to me; a second was
proposed by my mother, but from this my father delivered me by
expressing a decided disapproval.</p>

<p>My own desires and inclinations were now at last consulted. I wanted
to be an agriculturist in the full meaning of the word; for I loved
mountain, field, and forest; and I heard also that to learn anything
solid in this occupation one must be well acquainted with geometry and
land-surveying. From what I had learnt of the latter by snatches now and
then, the prospect of knowing more about it delighted me much; and I
cared not whether I began with forestry, with farming, or with geometry
and land-surveying. My father tried to find a position for me; but the
farmers asked too high a premium. Just at this time he became acquainted
with a forester who had also a considerable reputation as land-surveyor
and valuer. They soon came to terms, and I was apprenticed to this man
for two years, to learn forestry, valuing, geometry, and land-surveying.
I was fifteen years and a half old when I became an apprentice to the
forester, on Midsummer Day 1797.</p>

<p>It was two days' journey from my home to the forester's, for his
district was not in our country. The man often gave me proofs of his
thorough and many-sided knowledge; but he did not understand the art of
conveying his knowledge to others, especially because what he knew he
had acquired only by dint of <a name="page_025"></a> actual
experience.<a href="#page_025_note_18"><sup>18</sup></a> Further, some
work of timber-floating<a href="#page_025_note_19"><sup>19</sup></a>
with which he had been entrusted hindered him from devoting to me the
stipulated time necessary for my instruction.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw this quite clearly, my own activity of mind urged me
to make use of the really excellent books on forestry and geometry which
I found lying to my hand. I also made acquaintance with the doctor of a
little town near by, who studied natural science for his amusement; and
this friend lent me books on botany, through which I learnt also about
other plants than just those of the forest. A great deal of my time
during the absence of the forester (when I was left quite to myself) I
devoted to making a sort of map of the neighbourhood I lived in; but
botany was my special occupation. My life as forester's apprentice was a
four-fold one: firstly, there was the homelier and more practical side
of life; then the life spent with Nature, especially forest-nature; then
also a life of the study, devoted to work at mathematics and languages;
and lastly, the time spent in gaining a knowledge of plants. My chosen
profession and the other circumstances of my position might have brought
me into contact with many kinds of men; but nevertheless my life
remained retired and solitary. My religious church life now changed to a
religious communion with Nature, and in the last half-year I lived
entirely amongst and with my plants, which drew me towards them with
fascination, notwithstanding that as yet I had no sense of the inner
life of the plant world. Collecting and drying specimens of plants was a
work I prosecuted with the greatest care. Altogether this time of my
life was devoted in many various ways to self-education,
self-instruction, and moral advancement. Especially did I love to
indulge my old habit of self-observation and introspection.</p>

<p><a name="page_026"></a>I must mention yet another event of the
greatest importance from the point of view of my inner life. An hour's
walk from where I then lived was a small country town. A company of
strolling actors arrived there, and played in the prince's castle in the
town. After I had seen one of their performances, hardly any of those
which followed passed without my attendance. These performances made a
deep and lively impression upon me, and this the more that I felt as if
my soul at last received nourishment for which it had long hungered. The
impressions thus gained lasted so much the longer, and had so much the
greater influence on my self-culture, in that after each performance my
hour's walk home by dark or in the starlight allowed me to recapitulate
what I had heard, and so to digest the meaning of the play. I remember
especially how deeply a performance of Iffland's <i>Huntsmen</i> moved me,
and how it inspired me with firm moral resolutions, which I imprinted
deep in my mind under the light of the stars. My interest in the play
made me seek acquaintance with the actors, and especially with one of
them, an earnest young man who attracted my attention, and to whom I
spoke about his profession. I congratulated him on being a member of
such a company, able to call up such ennobling sentiments in the human
soul; perhaps even expressed a wish that I could become a member of such
a company. Then the honest fellow described the profession of an actor
as a brilliant, deceitful misery, and confessed to me that he had been
only forced by necessity to adopt this profession, and that he was soon
about to abandon it. Once again I learned by this to divide cause from
effect, internal from external things. My visits to the play brought
upon me a most unpleasant experience, for my father, when I spoke to him
without concealment of my playgoing, reproached me very bitterly for it.
He looked upon my conduct as deserving the highest punishment, which was
in absolute contradiction with my own view; for I placed the benefit I
had derived from my attendance at the play side by side with what I had
received by my attendance at church, and expressed something of the kind
to my father. As often happened in later life, so also on this occasion
it was my eldest brother who was the mediator between my father and
myself.</p>

<p><a name="page_027"></a>On Midsummer Day 1799 my apprenticeship came
to an end. The forester, who could now have made my practical knowledge
of service to himself, wished to keep me another year. But I had by this
time acquired higher views; I wished to study mathematics and botany
more thoroughly, and I was not to be kept back from my purpose. When my
apprenticeship was over I left him, and returned to my father's
house.</p>

<p>My master knew well that he had not done his duty towards me, and
with this probably humiliating consciousness before him, and in spite of
the thoroughly satisfactory testimonial that he gave me, he committed a
very mean action against me. He did not know anything about my private
study; for instance, my completely working through some elementary
mathematical books, which I had found myself quite well able to
understand. Besides, he was dissatisfied that I would not stay another
year with him. He therefore sent a letter to my father, in which he
complained bitterly of my conduct, and shifted the blame of my ignorance
of my calling entirely on to my shoulders. This letter actually arrived
at home before I did; and my father sent it on to my eldest brother, who
was minister in a village through which I had to pass on my way home.
Soon after I reached my brother's house he communicated to me the
contents of this inculpatory letter. I cleared myself by exposing the
unconscientious behaviour of my master, and by showing my private work.
I then wrote a reply to my master, clearly refuting all his accusations,
and exhibiting on the other hand his behaviour towards me; and with this
I satisfied my father and my brother. But the latter reproached me for
having suffered wrongdoing so long without complaint. To that I gave the
simple answer, that my father, at the beginning of my apprenticeship,
had told me not to come to him with any complaint, as I should never be
listened to, but should be considered as wrong beforehand. My brother,
who knew my father's severity and his views on such points, was silent.
But my mother saw in one declaration of the forester the confirmation of
her own opinion about me. The forester declared, that if ever anything
was made of me, the same good fortune might be told of the first-comer
without further trouble, and my mother assented heartily to his
opinion.</p>

<p><a name="page_028"></a>Thus disappeared once more the light, the
sunshine, which had gladdened me with its warmth, especially in the more
recent part of my life. The wings of my mind, which had begun to flutter
of themselves, were again bound, and my life once more appeared all cold
and harsh before me. Then it happened that my father had to send some
money to my brother (Traugott), who was studying medicine in Jena. The
matter pressed; so, as I had nothing to do, it was decided that I should
be the messenger.</p>

<p>When I reached Jena I was seized by the stirring intellectual life of
the place, and I longed to remain there a little time. Eight weeks of
the summer half-year's session of 1799 yet remained. My brother wrote to
my father that I could fill that time usefully and profitably in Jena,
and in consequence of this letter I was permitted to stay. I took
lessons in map and plan-drawing, and I devoted all the time I had to the
work. At Michaelmas I went home with my brother, and my step-mother
observed that I could now fairly say I had passed through the
university. But I thought differently; my intelligence and my soul had
been stimulated in many ways, and I expressed my wish to my father to be
allowed to study finance there, thus returning to my previous career. My
father was willing to give his permission if I could tell him how to
find the means. I possessed a very small property inherited from my
mother, but I thought it would be insufficient. However, after having
conferred with my brother, I talked it over with my father. I was still
a minor, and therefore had to ask the consent of my trustee to realise
my property; but as soon as I had obtained this I went as a student to
Jena, in 1799. I was then seventeen years and a half old.</p>

<p>A testimonial from my father attesting my capacity for the curriculum
procured me matriculation without difficulty. My matriculation
certificate called me a student of philosophy, which seemed very
strange, because I had set before me as the object of my studies
practical knowledge; and as to philosophy, of which I had so often
heard, I had formed a very high idea of it. The word made a great
impression upon my dreamy, easily-excited, and receptive nature.
Although the impression disappeared almost as soon as conceived, it
gave, however, higher and unexpected relations to my studies.</p>

<p><a name="page_029"></a>The lectures I heard were only those which
promised to be useful in the career I had now again embraced. I heard
lectures on applied mathematics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
mineralogy, botany, natural history, physics, chemistry, accounts,
cultivation of forest trees and management of forests, architecture,
house-building, and land-surveying. I continued topographical drawing. I
heard nothing purely theoretical except mathematics; and of
philosophical teaching and thought I learnt only so much as the
intercourse of university life brought with it; but it was precisely
through this intercourse that I received in various ways a many-sided
intellectual impulse. I usually grasped what had been taught; the more
thoroughly since, through my previous life, I had become well acquainted
with the principal subjects, and already knew their relation to
practical work.</p>

<p>Some of the lectures were almost easy for me&mdash;for instance,
those on mathematics. I have always been able to perceive with ease and
pleasure relations of geometrical figures and of planes; so that it
seemed inexplicable to me that every farmer should not be equally
capable of understanding them. This I had said before to my brother, who
tried to give me an explanation; but I did not yet grasp it. I had
expected I don't know exactly what, but certainly something higher,
something grandiose; very likely I had expected something with more life
in it. The mathematical course, therefore, at first seemed to me
unimportant; but later on I found that I, also, could not follow every
detail. However, I did not think much of this, because I readily
understood the general meaning, and I said to myself that particular
cases would not cause me any mental fatigue if I found it necessary to
learn them.</p>

<p>The lectures of my excellent teacher were not so useful to me as they
might have been, if I could have seen in the course of instruction and
in its progress somewhat more of necessary connection and less of
arbitrary arrangement. This want of necessary connection was the reason
of the immediate dislike I always took to every course of instruction. I
felt it even in pure mathematics, still more was it the case in applied
mathematics, and most of all in experimental physics. Here it seemed to
me as if everything were arranged in arbitrary series, so that from the
very first <a name="page_030"></a> I found this study a fatigue. The
experiments failed to arrest my attention. I desired and sought after
some inner connection between the phenomena, deduced from and explained
by some simple root principles. But that was the very point withheld
from me. Mathematical demonstrations came like halting messengers; they
only became clear to the mind's eye when the truth to be demonstrated
lay before me already in all its living strength. On the other hand, my
attention was riveted by the study of gravitation, of force, of weight,
which were living things to me, because of their evident relation to
actual facts.</p>

<p>In mechanics (natural philosophy) I could not understand why so many
of the so-called "mechanical powers" were assumed, and why several of
them were not reduced to cases of the inclined plane.</p>

<p>In mineralogy my previous education had left many gaps unfilled,
especially as regards the powers of observation. I was fond of mineral
specimens, and gave myself much trouble to comprehend their several
properties; but in consequence of my defective preparation I found
insuperable difficulties in my way, and perceived thereby that neglect
is neither quickly nor lightly to be repaired. The most assiduous
practice in observation failed to make my sight so quick and so accurate
as it ought to have been for my purpose. At that time I failed to
apprehend the fact of my deficient quickness of sight; it ought to have
taught me much, but I was not prepared to learn the lesson.</p>

<p>Chemistry fascinated me. The excellent teacher (Göttling) always
demonstrated the true connection of the phenomena under consideration;
and the theory of chemical affinity took strong hold upon me.</p>

<p>Note-taking at these lectures was a thing I never thought of doing;
for that which I understood forthwith became a part of me, and that
which I failed to understand seemed to me not worth writing down. I have
often felt sorry for it since. But as regards this point, I have always
had through my whole life the perfectly clear conviction that when I had
mastered a whole subject in its intimate relations I could go back upon,
and then understand, details which at the time of hearing had been
unintelligible to me.</p>

<p><a name="page_031"></a>In botany I had a clear-sighted, kind-hearted
teacher (Batsch). His natural system of botany<a
href="#page_031_note_20"><sup>20</sup></a> gave me great satisfaction,
although I had always a painful perception of how much still remained
for him to classify. However, my view of Nature as one whole became by
his means substantially clearer, and my love for the observation of
Nature in detail became more animated. I shall always think of him with
gratitude. He was also my teacher in natural history. Two principles
that he enunciated seized upon me with special force, and seemed to me
valid. The first was the conception of the mutual relationship of all
animals, extending like a network in all directions; and the second was
that the skeleton or bony framework of fishes, birds, and men was one
and the same in plan, and that the skeleton of man should be considered
as the fundamental type which Nature strove to produce even in the lower
forms of creation.<a href="#page_031_note_21"><sup>21</sup></a> I was
always highly delighted with his expositions, for they suggested ideas
to me which bore fruit both in my intelligence and in my emotional
nature. Invariably, whenever I grasped the inter-connection and unity of
phenomena, I felt the longings of my spirit and of my soul were
fulfilled.</p>

<p>I easily understood the other courses I attended, and was able to
take a comprehensive glance over the subjects of which they treated. I
had seen building going on, and had myself assisted in building, in
planting, etc.; here, therefore, I could take notes, and write complete
and satisfactory memoranda of the lectures.</p>

<p>My stay in Jena had taught me much; by no means so much as it ought
to have taught me, but yet I had won for myself <a name="page_032"></a>
a standpoint, both subjective and objective. I could already perceive
unity in diversity, the correlation of forces, the interconnection of
all living things, life in matter, and the principles of physics and
biology.</p>

<p>One thing more I have to bring forward from this period. Up till now
my life had met with no sympathetic recognition other than the esteem
which I had enjoyed of the country physician during my
apprenticeship&mdash;he who encouraged me to study natural science, and
smoothed away for me many a difficulty. But now such sympathy was
destined to offer itself as a means of education and improvement. For
there were in Jena just then two scientific associations, one for
natural history and botany, the other for mineralogy, as it was then
called. Many of the young students, who had shown living interest and
done active work in natural science, were invited to become members by
the President, and this elevating pleasure was also offered to me. At
the moment I certainly possessed few qualifications for membership; the
most I could say was that my faculty for arranging and classifying might
be made of some use in the Natural History Society, and this, indeed,
actually came to pass. Although my admission to this society had no
great effect upon my later life, because it was dissolved at the death
of its founder, and I did not keep up my acquaintance with the other
members afterwards, yet it awakened that yearning towards higher
scientific knowledge which now began to make itself forcibly felt within
me.</p>

<p>During my residence at the university I lived in a very retired and
economical way; my imperfect education, my disposition, and the state of
my purse alike contributing to this. I seldom appeared at places of
public resort, and in my reserved way I made my brother (Traugott) my
only companion; he was studying medicine in Jena during the first year
of my residence there.<a href="#page_032_note_22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a
name="page_033"></a> The theatre alone, of which I was still
passionately fond, I visited now and then. In the second year of this
first studentship, in spite of my quiet life, I found myself in an
awkward position. It began, indeed, with my entrance into the
university, but did not come to a head till my third half-year. When I
went to the university, my father gave me a bank draft for a small
amount to cover my expenses, not only for the first half-year, but for
the entire residence, I think. My brother, who, as I said, was with me
at Jena for the first year, wished me to lend him part of my allowance,
all of which I did not then require, whereas he was for the moment in
difficulties. He hoped soon to be able to repay me the money. I gladly
gave him the greater part of my little draft; but unfortunately I could
not get the money back, and therefore found myself in greater and
greater difficulties. My position became terribly urgent; my small
allowance had come to an end by the close of the first year, but I could
not bring myself to leave the university, especially now that a yearning
for scientific knowledge had seized me, and I hoped for great things
from my studies. Besides, I thought that my father might be induced to
support me at the university another half-year.</p>

<p>My father would hear nothing of this so far as he was concerned; and
my trustee would not agree to the conditions offered by my father (to
cover an advance); so I had to pay the penalty of their obstinacy.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my third half-year the urgency of my difficulties
increased. I owed the keeper of an eating-house (for meals) thirty
thalers, if I am not mistaken. As this man had caused me to be summoned
for payment several times before the Senate of the University, and I had
never been able to pay, and as he had even addressed my father, only to
receive from him a sharp refusal to entertain the matter, I was
threatened with imprisonment in the case of longer default of payment.
And I actually had to submit to this punishment. My step-mother inflamed
the displeasure of my father, and rejoiced at his inflexibility. My
trustee, who still had the disposal of some property of mine, could have
helped me, but did not, because the letter of the law was against any
interference from his side. Each one hoped by the continuance of my
sorry plight to break the stubbornness <a name="page_034"></a> of the
other. I served as scapegoat to the caprices of the obstinate couple,
and languished as such nine weeks long in the university prison at
Jena.<a href="#page_034_note_23"><sup>23</sup></a> At last my father
consented to advance me money on my formally abandoning, before the
university board, all claim on his property in the shape of inheritance;
and so, in the end, I got free.</p>

<p>In spite of the gloom into which my position as a prisoner plunged
me, the time of my arrest was not utterly barren. My late endeavours
towards scientific knowledge had made me more and more conscious of my
need of a solid foundation in my knowledge of Latin; therefore I now
tried to supply deficiencies to the extent of my ability, and with the
help of a friend. It was extremely hard to me, this working my way
through the dead and fragmentary teaching of an elementary grammar. It
always seemed to me as if the mere outer acquisition of a language could
but little help forward my true inner desire for knowledge, which was
deeply in earnest, and was the result of my own free choice. But
wherever the knowledge of language linked itself to definite external
impressions, and I was able to perceive its connection with facts, as,
for instance, in the scientific nomenclature of botany, I could quickly
make myself master of it. This peculiarity of mind passed by me
unnoticed at the time; I knew and understood too little, nay, indeed,
almost nothing of myself as yet, even as regards the actions of my
every-day life.</p>

<p>A second occupation of this prison period was the preparation of an
exercise (or academical thesis) in geometry, which I undertook that I
might the sooner obtain an independent position in some profession.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I studied Winckelmann's "Letters on Art." Through them some
germs of higher artistic feeling may have been awakened within me; for I
examined the engravings which the work contains with intense delight. I
could quite perceive the glow of pleasure that they aroused, but at the
time I took little <a name="page_035"></a> account of this influence,
and indeed the feeling for art altogether was late in developing itself
in me. When I now glance over the earlier and later, the greater and
smaller, artistic emotions which have swayed me, and observe their
source and direction, I see that it was with arts (sculpture as well as
music) as it was with languages&mdash;I never succeeded in accomplishing
the outward acquisition of them: yet I now feel vividly that I, too,
might have been capable of something in art had I had an artistic
education.</p>

<p>Further, there came into my hands, during the time of my
imprisonment, a bad translation of an abridgment of the Zendavesta. The
discovery [in these ancient Persian Scriptures] of similar life-truths
to our own, and yet coupled with a quite separate religious standpoint
from ours, aroused my attention, and gave some feeling of universality
to my life and thought; this, however, disappeared as quickly as it had
come.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the summer term in 1801 I was at length set free
from arrest. I at once left Jena and my academical career, and returned
to my father's house. I was just nineteen years old. It was but natural
that I should enter my parents' house with heavy heart, overclouded
soul, and oppressed mind. But spring warmed and awakened all nature once
more, and recalled to life, too, my slumbering desire for better
things.</p>

<p>As yet I had busied myself but little with German literature, and the
names of Schiller, Goethe, Wieland, and the rest I now, for the first
time, began to learn. In this, too, it was with me as in so many other
things; any mental influence that came before me I had either to fully
interweave with my inner life, or else altogether to forego its
acquisition.</p>

<p>With this peculiarity of temperament, I could master only a rather
restricted amount of mental material. My father's library was once more
ransacked. I found not much that was of any use to me, for it contained
chiefly theological works; but I seized with the greatest enjoyment on a
book which had come out some ten years before in Gotha, a general view
of all the sciences and fine arts in their various ramifications, with a
short sketch of the object of the several sciences and of the literature
of each department. The arrangement was based upon the usual division <a
name="page_036"></a> of the faculties, but it served to give me a
general outlook, long desired, over the whole of human knowledge, and I
was right glad to have found this "Mappe du monde littéraire"&mdash;for
that was its title. I resolved to turn this book to the best advantage I
could, and set about putting my resolution into practice. In order to
make a collection of comprehensive extracts of scientific matters from
the several periodicals received by my father (who shared for that
purpose in a joint subscription with other preachers and educated
people), I had already begun a sort of diary. The form of this journal
was shapeless&mdash;everything was put down as it came, one thing after
the other; and thereby the use of it all was rendered very inconvenient.
Now, however, I perceived the value of division according to a settled
plan, and soon hit upon a scheme of procedure.</p>

<p>I aimed at collecting all that seemed worthy to be known, all that
was necessary for cultured men in general, and for myself in my own
calling in particular; and this rich treasure was to be brought out
under favourable circumstances, or whenever need was, from its
storehouse. Also I desired to acquire a general idea of those subjects
which the craving for knowledge, growing ever more and more sharp within
my soul, was always urging me thoroughly to work through over again. I
felt happy in my work; and I had already been chained to my task for
several days, from early morning till late at night, in my little
distant chamber with its iron-barred windows, when my father suddenly
and unexpectedly walked into the room. He looked over what I had done,
and remarked the quantity of paper used over it, which indeed was not
small. Upon this cursory inspection he held my work for a foolish waste
of time and paper; and it would have been all over with my labour of
love for that time, if my brother (Christoph), who had so often stood as
protector by my side, had not just then been on a visit with us. He had
become the minister of a place which lay a few hours' journey from
Oberweissbach, and at this moment was staying with my parents. My father
at once told him of what he considered my useless, if not indeed
injurious occupation; but my brother saw it differently. I ventured,
therefore, to continue, with the silent permission of my father. And
indeed the work proved of actual service <a name="page_037"></a> to me,
for it brought a certain order, breadth, and firmness into my ideas
which had the most beneficial effect upon me.</p>

<p>My father now strove to procure me a settled position in my chosen
calling; or at all events to provide some active work which would bring
me into nearer connection with it. And for this purpose a fortunate
opportunity soon offered. Some of my father's relatives had property in
the district of Hildburghausen, managed by a steward. The friendly
footing on which my father stood with these relatives permitted me to
study practical farming under this steward. There I took part in all the
ordinary farming occupations. These, however, did not attract me
greatly, and I ought to have at once discovered what an unsuitable
career I had chosen, if I had but understood my own nature.</p>

<p>The thing that most painfully occupied my mind at this time was the
absence of cordial understanding between me and my father. At the same
time I could not help esteeming and honouring him. Notwithstanding his
advanced age he was still as strong and as healthy in body as in mind,
penetrating in speech and counsel, vigorous in fulfilment and actual
work, earnest, nay, hard, in address. He had a firm, strong will, and at
the same time was filled with noble, self-sacrificing endeavour. He
never shirked skirmish nor battle in the cause of what he deemed the
better part; he carried his pen into action, as a soldier carries his
sword, for the true, the good, and the right. I saw that my father was
growing old and was drawing near the grave, and it made me sorry to feel
that I was yet a stranger to such a father. I loved him, and felt how
much good resulted from that love; so I took the resolution to write to
my father, and by letter to show him my true nature, so far as I could
understand myself. Long did I revolve this letter in my mind; never did
I feel strength nor courage to write it. Meanwhile a letter called me
back home in November, after I had been some months engaged on the
estate. I was called upon to help my father, now quite weak and almost
bedridden; at all events I could assist him in his correspondence.
Family and other cares and the activities of life absorbed my whole
time. What I meant to have done in my letter now happily became possible
in speech from man to man, in glances from eye to eye. My father was
occupied by cares for my future <a name="page_038"></a> prospects up
till the end. He died in February 1802. May his enlightened spirit look
down full of peace and blessing upon me as I write; may he now be
content with that son who so loved him!</p>

<p>I now stood in every respect my own master, and might decide the
direction of my future life for myself, according to the circumstances
which lay around me. With this intention I once more left the paternal
roof at Easter, to undertake the post of clerk in the Office of Woods
and Forests which formed one part of the general administration (divided
into Treasury, Woods and Forests, and Tithe departments) of the as yet
episcopal territory of Bamberg.<a
href="#page_038_note_24"><sup>24</sup></a> My district lay amidst
unusual and lovely scenery; my duties were light, and when they were
over I was free to roam in the neighbourhood, now doubly beautiful in
the springtime, to live out my life in freedom, and gain strength for
mind and soul.</p>

<p>Thus once again I lived much out of doors and in companionship with
Nature. My chief was proud of the possession of a considerable library,
of which I made good use; and in this manner many of the publications
then issuing from the press, and treating of matters connected with the
occupation which I had chosen, passed through my hands, as well as those
on other subjects. I was especially attracted by some volumes which
contained aphorisms, thoughts, and observations on conduct, selected
from ancient and modern writers and thinkers. My character grew upon and
entwined itself around these aphorisms, which I could easily glance
over, and as easily retain, and, more than all, which I could weave into
my own life and thoughts, and by which I could examine my conduct. I
made extracts of those which were in closest accord with my inner life,
and bore them always about my person.</p>

<p>Amidst these surroundings my life contained many elements of growth.
Although my chief, as well as his family, was a strong Roman Catholic,
he chose a (Protestant) private tutor recommended to him by Professor
Carus. This gentleman had many <a name="page_039"></a> excellent
qualities, so that we soon became great friends. We had also both of us
the pleasure of being acquainted with some highly-cultured people, the
families of the physician, of the minister, and of the schoolmaster in
the neighbouring Protestant village, which was as yet still a fief of
the Empire.<a href="#page_039_note_25"><sup>25</sup></a> My friend the
tutor was a young man quite out of the common, with an actively
inquiring mind; especially fond of making plans for wide-stretching
travel, and comprehensive schemes of education. Our intercourse and our
life together were very confidential and open, for the subjects he cared
for were those dear to me; but we were of diametrically opposite
natures. He was a man of scholastic training, and I had been deficiently
educated. He was a youth who had plunged into strife with the world and
society; my thought was how to live in peace with myself and all men.
Besides, our outward lives bore such different aspects that a truly
intimate friendship could not exist between us. Nevertheless our very
contrasts bound us more closely together than we deemed.</p>

<p>Practical land surveying at this time chiefly interested me, for it
at once satisfied my love for out-of-doors life, and fully occupied my
intelligence. But the everlasting scribbling which now fell to my share
I could not long endure, in spite of my otherwise pleasant life.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1803 I left my situation and went to Bamberg,
feeling sure that the political changes by which Bamberg had been
transferred to Bavaria, and the general survey of the district which was
therefore in contemplation, would immediately provide me with a sphere
of work suited to my capabilities. My expectations were not falsified.
In pursuance of my plan I introduced myself to the land-surveyors in
Bamberg, and at once received employment from one of them. He had had
considerable surveys in hand, and was still engaged upon them. As I
showed some proficiency in mapping, he entrusted me with the preparation
of the necessary maps which accompanied the surveys. This <a
name="page_040"></a> kept me employed for some time on work
sufficiently remunerative for my needs.</p>

Of course the question in hand with the new Government was <p>the
appointment of land-surveyors, and those who were resident in the town
were invited to send in maps of Bamberg as specimens of their work.
Through the instruction I had enjoyed in my youth I was not unacquainted
with such work. I therefore took pleasure in drawing a map, which I sent
in. My work was approved, and I received something for it; but being a
stranger, inexperienced, and young, and having hardly taken the best way
towards my purposed aim, I obtained no appointment.</p>

<p>After I had finished the work I have mentioned the survey of a small
private property was put into my hands to carry out. From this
engagement ensued consequences which were most important for me. I note
only one point here. One of the joint owners of this property was a
young doctor of philosophy, who leaned towards the new school of
Schelling. It could hardly be expected but that we should talk over
things which stirred our mental life, and so it came about that he lent
me Schelling's "Bruno, oder über die Welt-seele"<a
href="#page_040_note_26"><sup>26</sup></a> to read. What I read in that
book moved me profoundly, and I thought I really understood it. The
friendly young fellow, not much older than myself&mdash;we had already
met in Jena,&mdash;saw the lively interest I was taking in the book,
and, in fact, I talked it over with him many a time. One day, after we
had been to see an important picture-gallery together, he addressed me
in these words, which from his mouth sounded startlingly strange, and
which at the time seemed to me inexplicable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Guard yourself against philosophy; she leads you towards doubt and
darkness. Devote yourself to art, which gives life, peace, and joy."</p>

<p>It is true I retained the young man's words, but I could not
understand them, for I regarded philosophy as a necessary part of the
life of mankind, and could not grasp the notion that one could be
verging towards darkness and doubt when one calmly investigated the
inner life. Art, on the other hand, lay much further from me than
philosophy; for except a profound enjoyment in works of art <a
name="page_041"></a> (for which I could give no clear reason), no
glimmering of an active &aelig;sthetic sense had yet dawned upon me. This
remark of my friend the doctor's called my attention to myself, however,
and to my life and its aim, and made me aware of two very different and
widely separate systems of life.</p>

<p>My friend, the tutor of the Government official under whom I had
served at Bamberg, had in the meantime left his situation. He told me
before leaving that he had it in his mind to go to Frankfurt, and thence
into France. I saw his departure with regret, little dreaming that life
would in a few years bring us together again, and that he would
indirectly decide my future career. But, as it so often happens in life,
parting in this instance but led up to meeting, and meeting to
parting.</p>

<p>The occurrences I have named had little result upon my outward life,
which for the time ran its peaceful course. I pass over many
circumstances important to the uplifting and development of my character
and my moral life, and come at once to the close of my stay in
Bamberg.</p>

<p>I had now once more earnestly to turn my attention to procuring
certain and settled employment. In truth, as regarded my future, I stood
quite alone. I had no one to lend me a helping hand, so I made up my
mind to go forward, trusting only in God and destiny. I determined to
seek for a situation by means of the <i>Allgemeine Anzeiger der
Deutschen</i>,<a href="#page_041_note_27"><sup>27</sup></a> a paper then
very much read, and I thought it would be good to send in to the editor,
as a proof of my assertions of competency, an architectural design, and
also a specimen of my work in practical surveying, together with
explanations of both of them. As soon as my plan was fully conceived I
set to work at it. For the architectural sketch I chose a design of a
nobleman's country mansion, with the surrounding outbuildings. When I
had finished it, with very few professional appliances to help me, it
contained a complete working out of all the various necessary plans, and
as a critical test of its accuracy and suitability to the proposed scale
of dimensions, I added a statement of all the particulars and conditions
involved in it. For the land-surveying I chose a table of measurements
compiled from <a name="page_042"></a> the map I had previously drawn,
which I carried through under certain arbitrary assumptions. These
works, together with my advertisement, I sent in 1803 to the office of
the paper I have mentioned, with the request that the editor, after
reading my testimonials and inspecting my work, would add a few
confirmatory words as to my qualifications. Work and testimonials alike
were to the satisfaction of the editor, and my request for an editorial
comment was granted. I received several offers, each one containing
something tempting about it. It was difficult to make a choice, but at
last I decided to accept a position offered me as private secretary to
the President and Privy-Councillor Von Dewitz, of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
at this time resident on one of his estates, Gross-Milchow.</p>

<p>Amongst the other offers was one from Privy-Councillor Von
Voldersdorf, who was looking out for an accountant for his estates in
the Oberpfalz.<a href="#page_042_note_28"><sup>28</sup></a> This
situation did not suit me so well as the other, but I accepted a
proposition to fill up the time till the arrangements for the other post
had been completed, by going down to these estates of Herr Von
Voldersdorf, and bringing into order, according to a certain specified
plan, the heavy accounts of his steward, which were at this time much in
arrear. I set off for the Oberpfalz in the first days of 1804. But I was
soon called away to Mecklenburg to the situation at Gross-Milchow which
I had definitively chosen, and in the raw, frightfully severe
winter-time of February I journeyed thither by the mail-coach. Yet,
short as had been my stay in the Oberpfalz, and continual and
uninterrupted as had been my labour in order that I might get through
the work I had undertaken, the time I spent in Bavaria yielded me much
that was instructive. The men, ingenuous, lively young fellows from
Saxony and Prussia, received me very kindly, and the variety of their
different services and their readiness to talk about them, gave me a
good insight into the inner relationship between the landed aristocracy
and their retainers. In recalling these circumstances I thankfully
acknowledge how my ever-tender loving destiny took pains kindly to
prepare me for each vocation next to come. I had never before had the
opportunity to see the <a name="page_043"></a> mode of keeping accounts
used on a great estate, to say nothing of keeping them myself, and here
I had this very work to do, and that after a plan both ample and clear,
in which every particular, down to the single details, was carefully
provided for. This was of the greatest service to me. Precisely the
conduct of such well-ordered accounts was to be my work later on;
therefore, having the general plan I have referred to firmly established
in my mind, and being well practised in its operation, I set off well
prepared for my new sphere of work. Thanks to this, I was able to
satisfy most completely not only my new employer, but also his lady, who
used to examine everything minutely with severe scrutiny.</p>

<p>The surroundings of Herr Von Dewitz's estate were uncommonly pretty
for that part of the country. Lakes and hills and the fresh foliage of
trees abounded, and what Nature had perhaps overlooked here and there
Art had made good. My good fortune has always led me amongst pretty
natural scenery. I have ever thankfully enjoyed what Nature has spread
before my eyes, and she has always been in true motherly unity with me.
As soon as I had gained some facility in it my new work became simple,
ran its regular course which was repeated week by week, and gave me time
to think about my own improvement.</p>

<p>However, my engagement on this estate was, after all, but a short
one. The bent of my life and disposition was already taken. A star had
arisen within my mind which I was impelled to follow. On this account I
could regard my employment at this time only as a sheet anchor, to be
let go as soon as an opportunity offered itself to resume my vocation.
This opportunity was not long in making its appearance.</p>

<p>My uncle (Hoffmann), who, like my brother, bore me always lovingly in
his thoughts, had lately died. Even on his deathbed he thought of me,
and charged my brother to do all he could to find me some settled
occupation for life, and at any rate to prevent me from leaving the post
I held at the moment before I had some reasonable prospect of a secure
and better engagement elsewhere. Providence willed it otherwise. His
death, through the small inheritance which thereby came to me, gave me
the means of fulfilling the dearest wish of my heart. So wonderfully
does God direct the fate of men.</p>

<p><a name="page_044"></a>I must mention one circumstance before I part
for ever in this account of my life from my gentle, loving
second-father. On my journey to Mecklenburg, when I saw my uncle (at
Stadt-Ilm) for the last time, I had the deep joy of a talk with him,
such as a trusting father might hold with his grown-up son, bound to him
by every tie of affection. He freely pointed out the faults which had
shown themselves in my boyhood, and told me of the anxiety they had at
one time caused him, and in this way he went back to the time when I was
taken into his family, and to the causes of that. "I loved your mother
very dearly," said he; "indeed, she was my favourite out of all my
brothers and sisters. In you I seemed to see my sister once more, and
for her love I took charge of you and bestowed on you that affection
which hitherto had been hers alone." And dear as my own mother had
become to me already through the many kind things I had heard said of
her, so that I had even formed a distinct conception of what she was
like, and seemed actually to remember her, she became even dearer to me
after these reminiscences of my uncle than before, for did I not owe to
her this noble and high-minded second-father? My conversation with my
uncle first made clear to me what in later life I have found repeatedly
confirmed&mdash;that the sources, springs or motives of one's present
actions often lie far away beyond the present time, outside the present
circumstances, and altogether disconnected with the persons with whom
one is concerned at the moment then passing. I have also repeatedly
observed in the course of my life that ties are the faster, the more
enduring and the truer the more they spring from higher, universal, and
impersonal sources.</p>

<p>The person who in Mecklenburg stood next above me in position in the
house and in the family was the private tutor, whom I found already
there&mdash;a young doctor of philosophy of Göttingen University. We did
not come much into contact on the whole since he as a university
graduate took a far higher stand than I; but through I came into some
connection with the clergymen of the district, and this was of benefit
to me. As for the farmers the bailiffs, etc., their hospitable nature
was quite sufficient of itself to afford me a hearty welcome. Thus I
lived in a way I had for a long time felt I much needed, amidst
many-sided <a name="page_045"></a> companionable good-fellowship,
cheerful and free. Healthy as I was in body and soul, in head and heart,
my thoughts full of brightness and cheerfulness, it was not long before
my mind again felt an eager desire for higher culture. The young tutor
went away, and after his departure my craving for culture grew keener
and keener, for I missed the intellectual converse I had been able to
hold with him. But I was soon again to receive succour.</p>

<p>The President,<a href="#page_045_note_29"><sup>29</sup></a> besides
the family at home, had two sons at the Pädagogium in Halle.<a
href="#page_045_note_30"><sup>30</sup></a> They came to visit their
parents, accompanied by their special tutor, a gentleman destined to
become famous later on as the renowned scholar, Dr. Wollweide.</p>

<p>Dr. Wollweide was a mathematician and a physicist, and I found him
freely communicative. He was so kind as to mention and explain to me the
many various problems he had set before himself to work out. This caused
my long slumbering and suppressed love for mathematics as a science, and
for physics, to spring up again, fully awake. For some time past my
tendency had leaned more and more towards architecture, and, indeed, I
had now firmly determined to choose that as my profession, and to study
it henceforth with all earnestness. My intellectual cravings and the
choice of a profession seemed at last to run together, and I felt
continually bright and happy at the thought. I seized the opportunity of
the presence of the scholar whom I have named to learn from him what
were the best books on those subjects which promised to be useful to me,
and my first care was to become possessed of them. Architecture was now
vigorously studied, and other books, too, were not suffered to lie
idle.</p>

<p>The following books took great hold upon me: Pröschke's "Fragments on
Anthropology" (a small unpretending book), Novalis' Works, and Arndt's
"Germany" and "Europe."<a href="#page_045_note_31"><sup>31</sup></a> The
<a name="page_046"></a> first of these at one stroke drew together, so
that I could recognise in them myself as a connected whole, my outer
existence, my inner character, my disposition, and the course of my
life. I for the first time realised myself and my life as a single
entity in contrast to the whole world outside of me.<a
href="#page_046_note_32"><sup>32</sup></a> The second book lay before me
the most secret emotions, perceptions, and intentions of my inmost soul,
clear, open, and vivid. If I parted with that book it seemed as if I had
parted with myself; if anything happened to the book I felt as though it
had happened to me, only more deeply and with greater pain. The third
book taught me of man in his broad historical relations, set before me
the general life of my kind as one great whole, and showed me how I was
bound to my own nation, both to my ancestors and my contemporaries. Yet
the service this last book had done me was hardly recognised at this
time; for my thoughts were bent on a definite outward aim, that of
becoming an architect. But I could at all events recognise the new eager
life which had seized me, and to mark this change to myself, I now began
to use as a Christian name the last instead of the first of my baptismal
names.<a href="#page_046_note_33"><sup>33</sup></a> Other circumstances
also impelled me to make this change; and, further, it freed me from the
memory of the many disagreeable impressions of my boyhood which
clustered round the name I was then called.</p>

<p>The time had come when I could no longer remain satisfied with my
present occupation; and I therefore sent in my resignation. The
immediate outward circumstance which decided me was this. I had kept up
a correspondence with the young man whom I had known as a private tutor
when I held a Government clerkship in Bamberg, and who left his
situation to go to Frankfurt, and then on into France.<a
href="#page_046_note_34"><sup>34</sup></a> He had afterwards lived some
time in Frankfurt, occupying himself with teaching, and now was again a
private tutor in a merchant's house in the Netherlands. I imparted <a
name="page_047"></a> to him my desire to leave my present post, and to
seek a situation with an architect; and asked his opinion whether I
should not be most likely to effect my object at Frankfurt, where so
many streams of diverse life and of men intermingle. And as my friend
was accurately acquainted with the ins and outs of Frankfurt life, I
asked him to give me such indications as he could of the best road to
take towards the fulfilment of my designs. My friend entered heartily
into my project, and wrote to me that he intended himself to spend some
time in Frankfurt again in the early summer; and he suggested that if I
could manage to be there at the same time, a mutual consideration of the
whole matter on the spot would be the best way of going to work. In
consequence of this I at once firmly decided to leave my situation in
the following spring, and to join my friend at Frankfurt. But where was
I to find the money necessary for such a journey? I had required the
whole of my salary up till now to cover my personal expenses and the
settlement of some debts I had run up at Bamberg.</p>

<p>In this perplexity I wrote again to my eldest brother, who had up
till now understood me so well, and I asked him for assistance. I was at
this time in a peculiar dilemma. On the one hand, I felt very keenly
that I must get out of my present position, while on the other, by my
unchanging changeableness I feared to wear out the indulgence and
patience of my worthy brother. In this strait I just gave him what
seemed to me as I wrote it an exact account of my real state of mind;
telling him that I could only find my life-aim in a continual striving
towards inward perfection.</p>

<p>My brother's answer arrived. With a joyful tremor and agitation I
held it in my hands. For hours together I carried it about me before I
unsealed it, for days together before I read it; it seemed so improbable
that my brother would feel himself able to help me towards the
accomplishment of the desire of my soul, and I feared to find in that
letter the frustration of my life's endeavour. When, after some days of
vacillation between hope and doubt, I could bear the situation no
longer, and opened the letter, I was not a little astonished that it
began by addressing me at once in terms of the most moving sympathy. As
I read on the contents agitated me deeply. The letter gave me the <a
name="page_048"></a> news of my beloved uncle's death, and informed me
of legacies left by him to me and my brothers. Thus fate itself, though
in a manner so deeply affecting, provided me with the means for working
out my next plan.</p>

<p>The die was now cast. From this moment onwards my inner life received
a quite new signification and a fresh character, and yet I was
unconscious of all this. I was like a tree which flowers and knows it
not. My inward and outward vocation and endeavour, my true life-destiny
and my apparent life-aim were still, however, in a state of separation,
and indeed of conflict, of which I had not the remotest conception. My
resolve held firm to make architecture my profession; it was purely as a
future architect that I took leave of all my companions.</p>

<p>At the end of April 1805, with peace in my heart, cheerfulness in my
soul, an eager disposition, and a mind full of energy, I quitted my old
surroundings. The first days of an unusually lovely May (and I might
here again recall what I pointed out above, that my inner and personal
life invariably went familiarly hand in hand with external Nature) I
spent with a friend, as a holiday, in the best sense of the word. This
was a dear friend of mine, who lived on an exceedingly finely-situated
farm in the Uckermark.<a href="#page_048_note_35"><sup>35</sup></a> Art
had improved the beauty of the somewhat simple natural features of the
place, in the most cunningly-devised fashion. In this beautiful,
retired, and even solitary spot, I flitted, as it were, from one flower
to another like a very butterfly. I had always passionately loved Nature
in her adornments of colour and of dewy pearls, and clung to her closely
with the gladsomeness of youth. Here I made the discovery that a
landscape which we look upon in sympathetic mood shines with enhanced
brilliancy; or as I put the truth into words at the time, "The more
intimately we attach ourselves to Nature, the more she glows with beauty
and returns us all our affection." This was the first time my mind had
ventured to give expression <a name="page_049"></a> to a sentiment
which thrilled my soul. Often in later life has this phrase proved
itself a very truth to me. My friend one day begged me to write
something in his album: I did so unwillingly. To write anything borrowed
went against me, for it jarred with the relations existing between me
and the book's owner; and to think of anything original was a task I
felt to be almost beyond my powers. However, after long thinking it over
in the open air, comparing my friend's life and my own in all their
aspects, I decided upon the following phrase:&mdash;"To thee may destiny
soon grant a settled home and a loving wife! To me, while she drives me
restless abroad, may she leave but just so much time as to allow me
fairly to discern my relations with my inmost self and with the world."
Then my thoughts grew clear, and I continued, "Thou givest man bread;
let my aim be to give man himself."</p>

<p>I did not even then fully apprehend the meaning of what I had said
and written, or I could not of course have held so firmly to my
architecture scheme. I knew as yet neither myself nor my real life,
neither my goal nor my life's path thither. And long afterwards, when I
had for some time been engaged upon my true vocation, I was not a little
astonished over the prophetic nature of this album-phrase of mine.</p>

<p>In later life I have often observed that a man's spirit, when it
first begins to stir within him, utters many a far-away prophetic
thought, which yet, in riper age, attains its realisation, its
consummation. I have especially noticed this recently in bright-minded
and active children; in fact, I have often been quite astounded at the
really deep truths expressed by them in their butterfly life. I seemed
to catch glimpses of a symbolic truth in this; as if indeed the human
soul were even already beginning to shake itself free from its
chrysalis-wrapping, or were bursting off the last fragments of the
eggshell.</p>

<p>In May 1805, while on my journey, I visited my eldest brother, of
whom I have so often spoken, and shall have yet so often to speak, and
found him in another district, to which he had been appointed minister.
He was as kind and full of affection as ever; and instead of blaming me,
spoke with especial approval of my new plans. He told me of projects
which had allured him in his <a name="page_050"></a> youth, and still
allured, but which he had lacked the strength of mind to speak of. His
father's advice and authority had overawed him in youth, and now the
chain of a settled position in life held him fast. To follow the inward
voice faithfully and without swerving was the advice he offered me, and
he wrote this memorandum in my album when I left him, as a life
motto:&mdash;"The task of man is a struggle towards an end. Do your duty
as a man, dear brother, with firmness and resolution, fight against the
difficulties which will thrust themselves in your path, and be assured
you will attain the end."</p>

<p>Thus cheered by sympathy and approval, I went my way from my
brother's, strengthened and confirmed in my determination. My road lay
over the Wartburg.<a href="#page_050_note_36"><sup>36</sup></a> Luther's
life and fame were then not nearly so well appreciated and so generally
understood as now, after the Tercentenary festival of the Reformation.<a
href="#page_050_note_37"><sup>37</sup></a> My early education had not
been of the kind to give me a complete survey of Luther's life and its
struggle; I was hardly thoroughly acquainted indeed with the separate
events of it. Yet I had learnt in some sort to appreciate this fighter
for the truth, by having in my last years at school to read aloud the
Augsburg Confession to the assembled congregation during the afternoon
service on certain specified Sundays, according to an old-fashioned
Church custom.<a href="#page_050_note_38"><sup>38</sup></a> I was filled
with a deep sense of reverence as I climbed "Luther's path," thinking at
the same time that Luther had left much behind still to be done, to be
rooted out, or to be built up.</p>

<p>Shortly before Midsummer Day, as I had arranged with my friend, I
reached Frankfurt. During my many weeks' journey in the lovely
springtime, my thoughts had had time to grow calm and collected. My
friend, too, was true to his word; and we at once set to work together
to prepare a prosperous future for me. The plan of seeking a situation
with an architect was still firmly <a name="page_051"></a> held to, and
circumstances seemed favourable for its realisation; but my friend at
last advised me to secure a livelihood by giving lessons for a time,
until we should find something more definite than had yet appeared.
Every prospect of a speedy fulfilment of my wishes seemed to offer, and
yet in proportion as my hopes grew more clear, a certain feeling of
oppression manifested itself more and more within me. I soon began
seriously to ask myself, therefore:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is this? Canst thou do work in architecture worthy of a man's
life? Canst thou use it to the culture and the ennoblement of
mankind?"</p>

<p>I answered my own question to my satisfaction. Yet I could not
conceal from myself that it would be difficult to follow this profession
conformably with the ideal I had now set before me. Notwithstanding
this, I still remained faithful to my original scheme, and soon began to
study under an architect with a view to fitting myself for my new
profession.</p>

<p>My friend, unceasingly working towards the accomplishment of my
views, introduced me to a friend of his, Herr Gruner, the headmaster at
that time of the Frankfurt Model School,<a
href="#page_051_note_39"><sup>39</sup></a> which had not long been
established. Here I found open-minded young people who met me readily
and ingenuously, and our conversation soon ranged freely over life and
its many-sided aspects. My own life and its object were also brought
forward and talked over. I spoke openly, manifesting myself just as I
was, saying what I knew and what I did not know about myself.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gruner, turning to me, "give up architecture; it is not
your vocation at all. Become a teacher. We want a teacher in our own
school. Say you agree, and the place shall be yours."</p>

<p>My friend was for accepting Gruner's proposal, and I began to
hesitate. Added to this, an external circumstance now came to my
knowledge which hastened my decision. I received the news namely, that
the whole of my testimonials, and particularly those <a
name="page_052"></a> that I had received in Jena, which were amongst
them, had been lost. They had been sent to a gentleman who took a lively
interest in my affairs, and I never found out through what mischance
they were lost. I now read this to mean that Providence itself had thus
broken up the bridge behind me, and cut off all return. I deliberated no
longer, but eagerly and joyfully seized the hand held out to me, and
quickly became a teacher in the Model School of Frankfurt-on-the-Main.<a
href="#page_052_note_40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The watchword of teaching and of education was at this time the name
of PESTALOZZI. It soon became evident to me that Pestalozzi was to be
the watchword of my life also; for not only Gruner, but also a second
teacher at the school, were pupils of Pestalozzi, and the first-named
had even written a book on his method of teaching. The name had a
magnetic effect upon me, the more so as during my self-development and
self-education it had seemed to me an aspiration&mdash;a something
perhaps never to be familiarly known, yet distinct enough, and at all
events inspiriting. And now I recalled how in my early boyhood, in my
father's house, I had got a certain piece of news out of some newspaper
or another, or at least that is how the matter stood in my memory. I
gathered that in Switzerland a man of forty, who lived retired from the
world,&mdash;Pestalozzi by name,&mdash;had taught himself, alone and
unaided, reading, writing, and arithmetic. Just at that time I was
feeling the slowness and insufficiency of my own development, and this
news quieted me, and filled me with the hope and trust that I, too,
might, through my own endeavour, repair the deficiencies of my
bringing-up. As I have grown older I have also found it consolatory to
remark how the culture of vigorous, capable men has not seldom been
acquired remarkably late in life. And in general I must acknowledge it
as part of the groundwork underlying my life and the evolution of my
character, that the contemplation of the actual existences of real men
always wrought upon my soul, as it were, by a fruitful rain and the
genial warmth of sunshine; while the isolated truths these lives
enshrined, the <a name="page_053"></a> principles those who lived them
had thought out and embodied in some phrase or another, fell as precious
seed-corn, as it were, or as solvent salt crystals upon my thirsty
spirit. And while on this head I cannot help especially calling to mind
how deep and lasting was the impression made upon me in my last year at
school by the accounts in the Holy Scriptures of the lives of earnestly
striving youths and men. I mention it here, but I shall have to return
to the subject later on.<a
href="#page_053_note_41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Now to return to the new life which I had begun. It was only to be
expected that each thing and all things I heard of Pestalozzi seized
powerfully upon me; and this more especially applies to a sketchy
narrative of his life, his aims, and his struggles, which I found in a
literary newspaper, where also was stated Pestalozzi's well-known desire
and endeavour&mdash;namely, in some nook or corner of the world, no
matter where, to build up an institution for the education of the poor,
after his own heart. This narrative, especially the last point of it,
was to my heart like oil poured on fire. There and then the resolution
was taken to go and look upon this man who could so think and so
endeavour to act, and to study his life and its work.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards (it was towards the end of August 1805) I was
already on the road to Yverdon,<a
href="#page_053_note_42"><sup>42</sup></a> where Pestalozzi had not long
before established himself. Once arrived there, and having met with the
friendliest reception by Pestalozzi and his teachers, because of my
introductions from Gruner and his colleagues, I was taken, like every
other visitor, to the class-rooms, and there left more or less to my own
devices. I was still very inexperienced, both in the theory and practice
of teaching, relying chiefly in such things upon my memory of my own
school-time, and I was therefore very little fitted for a rigorous
examination into details of method and into the way they were connected
to form a whole system. The latter point, indeed, was neither clearly
thought out, nor was it worked out in practice. What I saw was to me at
once elevating and depressing, arousing and also bewildering. <a
name="page_054"></a> My visit lasted only a fortnight. I worked away and
tried to take in as much as I could; especially as, to help me in the
duties I had undertaken, I felt impelled to give a faithful account in
writing of my views on the whole system, and the effect it had produced
upon me. With this idea I tried to hold fast in my memory all I heard.
Nevertheless I soon felt that heart and mind would alike come to grief
in a man of my disposition if I were to stay longer with Pestalozzi,
much as I desired to do so. At that time the life there was especially
vigorous; internally and externally it was a living, moving, stirring
existence, for Prince Hardenberg, commissioned by the Austrian
Government, had come to examine thoroughly into Pestalozzi's work.<a
href="#page_054_note_43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>The fruits of my short stay with Pestalozzi were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, I saw the whole training of a great educational
institution, worked upon a clear and firmly-settled plan of teaching. I
still possess the "teaching-plan" of Pestalozzi's institution in use at
that time. This teaching-plan contains, in my opinion, much that is
excellent, somewhat also that is prejudicial. Excellent, I thought, was
the contrivance of the so-called "exchange classes."<a
href="#page_054_note_44"><sup>44</sup></a> In each subject the
instruction was always given through the entire establishment at the
same time. Thus the subjects for teaching were settled for every class,
but the pupils were distributed amongst the various classes according to
their proficiency in the subject in hand, so that the whole body of
pupils was redistributed in quite a distinct division for each subject.
The advantage of this contrivance struck me as so undeniable and so
forcible that I have never since relinquished it in my educational work,
nor could I now bring myself to do so. The prejudicial side of the
teaching-plan, against which I intuitively rebelled, although my own
tendencies on the subject were as yet so vague and dim, lay, in my
opinion, in its incompleteness and its onesidedness. Several subjects of
teaching <a name="page_055"></a> and education highly important to the
all-round harmonious development of a man seemed to me thrust far too
much into the background, treated in step-motherly fashion, and
superficially worked out.</p>

<p>The results of the arithmetical teaching astounded me, yet I could
not follow it into its larger applications and wider extent. The
mechanical rules of this branch of instruction seemed to whirl me round
and round as in a whirlpool. The teacher was Krüsi. The teaching, in
spite of the brilliant results within its own circle, and in spite of
the sharpness of the quickened powers of perception and comprehension in
the children by which it attained those results, yet, to my personal
taste, had something too positive in its setting forth, too mechanical
in its reception. And Josias Schmid<a
href="#page_055_note_45"><sup>45</sup></a> had already, even at that
time, felt the imperfection of this branch of instruction. He imparted
to me the first ground-principles of his later work on the subject, and
his ideas at once commanded my approval, for I saw they possessed two
important properties, manysidedness and an exhaustive scientific
basis.</p>

<p>The teaching of drawing was also very incomplete, especially in its
first commencement; but drawing from right-angled prisms with equal
sides, in various lengths, which was one of the exercises required at a
later stage, and drawing other mathematical figures by means of which
the comprehension of the forms of actual objects of every-day life might
be facilitated were much more to my mind. Schmid's method of drawing had
not yet appeared.</p>

<p>In physical geography, the usual school course, with its
many-coloured maps, had been left far behind. Tobler, an active young
man, was the principal teacher in this section. Still, even this branch
had far too much positive instruction<a
href="#page_055_note_46"><sup>46</sup></a> for me. Particularly
unpleasant to me was the commencement of the course, which began with an
account of the bottom of the sea, although <a name="page_056"></a> the
pupils could have no conception of their own as to its nature or
dimensions. Nevertheless the teaching aroused astonishment, and carried
one involuntarily along with it through the impression made by the
lightning-quickness of the answers of the children.</p>

<p>In natural history I heard only the botany. The principal teacher,
who had also prepared the plan of instruction in this subject for all
the school, was Hopf, like the rest an active young man. The school
course arranged and carried out by him had much that was excellent. In
each separate instance&mdash;for example, the shape and position of
leaves, flowers, etc.&mdash;he would first obtain all the possible
varieties of form by question and answer between the class and himself,
and then he would select from the results the form which was before them
in nature. These lessons, which were in this way made so attractive, and
whose merits spoke for themselves, showed, however, when it came to
practical application, an unpractical, I had almost said, a
self-contradictory aspect.</p>

<p>(When, afterwards, in 1808, I visited Yverdon for the second time, I
found to my regret neither Tobler nor Hopf there.)</p>

<p>With the method used for the German language I could not at all bring
myself into sympathy, although it has been introduced into later school
books elsewhere. Here also the arbitrary and non-productive style of
teaching ran strongly counter to me at every step.</p>

<p>Singing was taught from figures.<a
href="#page_056_note_47"><sup>47</sup></a> Reading was taught from
Pestalozzi's well-known "A.B.C."</p>

<p>[Memorandum.&mdash;All this lay dark within me, its value
unrecognised even by myself. But my intellectual position tended to
become more settled by passing through these experiences. As to my state
at the time, I have, as accurately as may be, described it above, as at
once exalted and depressed, animated and dull. That Pestalozzi himself
was carried away and <a name="page_057"></a> bewildered by this great
intellectual machine of his appears from the fact that he could never
give any definite account of his idea, his plan, his intention. He
always said, "Go and see for yourself" (very good for him who knew <i>how</i>
to look, how to hear, how to perceive); "it works splendidly!"<a
href="#page_057_note_48"><sup>48</sup></a> It was at that time, indeed,
surprising and inexplicable to me that Pestalozzi's loving character did
not win every one's heart as it won mine, and compel the staff of
teachers to draw together into a connected whole, penetrated with life
and intellectual strength in every part. His morning and evening
addresses were deeply touching in their simplicity; and yet I remarked
in them even already at that time some slight traces of the unhappy
dissensions afterwards to arise.<a
href="#page_057_note_49"><sup>49</sup></a>]</p>

<p>I left Yverdon in mid-October (1805) with a settled resolution to
return thither as soon as possible for a longer stay. As soon as I got
back to Frankfurt, I received my definite appointment from the
Consistorium.<a href="#page_057_note_50"><sup>50</sup></a> The work that
awaited me upon my arrival from Switzerland at the Model School (which
was, in fact, properly two schools, one for boys and one for girls) was
a share in the arrangement of an entirely new educational course and
teaching-plan for the whole establishment. The school contained four or
five classes of boys and two or three of girls; altogether about two
hundred children. The staff consisted of four permanent masters and nine
visiting masters.</p>

<p>As I threw myself heartily into the consideration of the necessities
and the present position of the school, and of the instruction given
there, the working out of this plan was left almost wholly in my hands,
under the conditions imposed upon us. The scheme I produced not only
succeeded in winning the approbation of the authorities, but proved
itself during a long period <a name="page_058"></a> of service
beneficial in the highest degree, both to the institution itself and to
its efficiency; notwithstanding that it put the teachers to some
considerable personal inconvenience, as well as making larger claims
upon their time than was usual.</p>

<p>The subjects of instruction which fell to my share were arithmetic,
drawing, physical geography, and German. I generally taught in the
middle classes. In a letter to my brother I spoke of the impression made
upon me by my first lesson to a class of thirty or forty boys ranging
from nine to eleven; it seemed as if I had found something I had never
known, but always longed for, always missed, as if my life had at last
discovered its native element. I felt as happy as the fish in the water,
the bird in the air.</p>

<p>But before I pursue this side of the development of my life I must
touch upon another which was far more important to the evolution of my
character as man, as teacher, and as educationist, and which, indeed,
soon absorbed the first within itself.</p>

<p>Not long after my old friend, to meet with whom I had come to
Frankfurt, had introduced me to Gruner, he went back himself to his work
as private tutor. Afterwards he heard of a family (in Frankfurt)
desiring a private tutor for the sons. Since he could not introduce me
personally to this family he did so by letter, and several weeks before
my journey to Yverdon he had, in fact, written to them about me in very
kindly terms. It was for three sons principally that instruction and
education were required. They came to see me, and after they had gone
their personal peculiarities and their previous teaching and training,
with the results, were fully described to me, and I was then consulted
as to their future education. Now to education as an object<a
href="#page_058_note_51"><sup>51</sup></a> I had in truth never yet
given a thought, and the question threw me into great perplexity.
Nevertheless it required an answer, and moreover a precise answer.</p>

<p>In the life and circumstances of these lads I discovered frequent
similarities with my own boyhood, which sprang to my memory as I
listened. I could therefore answer the questions which were <a
name="page_059"></a> put to me out of the development and educational
experiences of my own life; and my reply, torn as it was from actual
life, keenly felt and vigorously expressed, bore upon it the stamp of
truth. It was satisfactory to the parents; and
education&mdash;development, which hitherto had been subjective alone
for me&mdash;that is, as self-development&mdash;now took an objective
form, a change which was distinctly painful to me. Long, long it was
before I could bring this business of education into a form expressible
by words. I only knew education, and I could only educate, through
direct personal association. This, then, I cultivated to the best of my
power, following the path whither my vocation and my life now called
me.</p>

<p>To say truth, I had a silent inward reluctance towards private
tutorship. I felt the constant interruptions and the piece-meal nature
of the work inseparable from the conditions of the case, and hence I
suspected that it might want vitality; but the trusting indulgence with
which I was met, and especially the clear, bright, friendly glance which
greeted me from the two younger lads, decided me to undertake to give
the boys lessons for two hours a day, and to share their walks. The
actual teaching was to be in arithmetic and German. The first was soon
arranged. I simply followed Pestalozzi's course. But as to the language
I encountered great difficulties. I began by teaching it from the
regular school-books then used, and indeed still in use. I prepared
myself to the best of my ability for each lesson, and worked up whatever
I felt myself ignorant of in the most careful and diligent way. But the
mode of teaching employed in these books frustrated my efforts. I could
neither get on myself nor get my pupils on with it. So I began to take
for my method Pestalozzi's "Mothers' Book." In this way we went on much
better, but still I was not satisfied; and, indeed, I may say that for a
very long time no system of instruction in German did satisfy me.</p>

<p>In arithmetic, by using the "Tables of Units"<a
href="#page_059_note_52"><sup>52</sup></a> in Pestalozzi's <a
name="page_060"></a> pamphlet, I arrived at the same results which I
had seen in Switzerland. Very often my pupils had the answer ready when
the last word of the question had scarcely been spoken. Yet I presently
found out some defects in this method of teaching, of which I shall
speak later on.<a href="#page_060_note_53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>When we were out walking together, I endeavoured to my utmost to
penetrate into the lives of the children, and so to influence them for
good. I lived my own early life over again, but in a happier way, for it
now lay clear and intelligible before me in its special as well as its
general characteristics.</p>

<p>All my thoughts and work were now directed to the subject of the
culture and education of man. This period of my life became full of
zeal, of active development, of advancing culture, and, in consequence,
of happiness. And my life in the Model School also, with my boys and
with my excellent colleagues, unusually clever men, was very elevating
and encouraging.</p>

<p>Owing to the position and surroundings of the school buildings,
which, though not apparently extensive as seen from the street,
contained a considerable courtyard and a spacious garden, the scholars
enjoyed perfect freedom of exercise, and could play just as they liked
in courtyard or garden; with the result, moreover, of thereby affording
a most important opportunity to the various teachers of becoming really
intimate with the characters of the boys they taught. And there grew up
out of all this a voluntary resolution on the part of the teachers that
every teacher should take his boys for a walk once a week. Each adopted
the method he liked best; some preferred to occupy the time of the walk
over a permanent subject; others preferred leaving the subject to
chance. I usually occupied my class with botanising; and also as
geographical master, I turned these occasions to profit by leading on my
boys to think for themselves and to apprehend the relations of various
parts of the earth's surface: on these and other perceptions gained in
this way I based my instruction in physiography, making them my point of
departure.</p>

<p>The town was at once my starting-place and my centre. From <a
name="page_061"></a> it I extended our observations to the right and to
the left, on this side and on that. I took the river Main as a base
line, just as it lay; or I used the line of hills or the distant
mountains. I settled firmly the direction of the four quarters of the
compass. In everything I followed the leading of Nature herself, and
with the data so obtained I worked out a representation of the place
from direct observation, and on a reduced scale, in some level spot of
ground or sandy tract carefully chosen for the purpose. When my
representation (or map) was thoroughly understood and well impressed on
every one's mind, then we reconstructed it in school on a black board
placed horizontally. The map was first sketched by teachers and pupils
between them, and then each pupil had to do it by himself as an
exercise. These representations of the earth's surface of ours had a
round contour, resembling the circular outline of the visible
horizon.</p>

<p>At the next public examination of the school, I was fortunate enough,
although this first attempt was full of imperfections, to win the
unanimous approval of the parents present; and not only that, but the
especial commendation of my superiors. Every one said, "That is how
physiography<a href="#page_061_note_54"><sup>54</sup></a> should be
taught. A boy must first learn all about his home before he goes further
afield." My boys were as well acquainted with the surroundings of the
town as with their own rooms at home; and gave rapid and striking
answers as to all the natural peculiarities of the neighbourhood. This
course was the fountain-head of the teaching method which I afterwards
thoroughly worked out, and which has now been in use for many years.</p>

<p>In arithmetic I did not take the lower, but the middle classes; and
here also my teaching received cheering encomiums.</p>

<p>In drawing I also taught the middle classes. My method in this
subject was to work at the thorough comprehension and the representation
of planes and solids in outline, rising from the simplest forms to
complex combinations. I not only had the gratification of obtaining good
results, which thoroughly satisfied those who tested them, but also of
seeing my pupils work with pleasure, with ardour, and with
individuality. <a name="page_062"></a> In the girls' school I had to
teach orthography<a href="#page_062_note_55"><sup>55</sup></a> in one of
the elementary classes. This lesson, ordinarily standing by itself,
disconnected with anything, I based upon correct pronunciation.<a
href="#page_062_note_56"><sup>56</sup></a> The teaching was imperfect,
certainly; but it nevertheless gained an unmistakable charm for both
teacher and pupils; and, finally, its results were very
satisfactory.</p>

<p>In one of the other classes of the girls' school I taught preparatory
drawing. I took this by combinations of single lines; but the method was
wanting in a logically necessary connection, so that it did not satisfy
me. I cannot remember whether the results of this teaching were brought
to the test or not.</p>

<p>Such was the outcome of my first attempts as a teacher. The kind
indulgence and approval granted to me, more because of my good
intentions and the fire of my zeal than for my actual performance,
spurred me on to plunge deeper into the inquiry as to the nature of true
teaching. But the whole system of a large school must have its settled
form, with its previously-appointed teaching-course arranged as to times
and subjects; and everything must fit in like a piece of clockwork. My
system, on the other hand, called only for ready senses and awakened
intellect. Set forms could only tolerate this view of education so far
as it served to enliven and quicken them. But I have unfortunately again
and again observed during my career, that even the most active life, if
its activity and its vitality be not properly understood and urged ever
onward, easily stiffens into bony rigidity. Enough, my mind, now fully
awakened, could not suffer these set forms, necessary though they were;
and I felt that I must seek out some position in which my nature could
unfold itself freely according to the needs of the development of my
life and of my mind.</p>

<p>This longing endeavour of life and mind, which could not submit to
the fetters of external limitations, may have been the more exaggerated
at the time by my becoming acquainted with Arndt's "Fragments on Human
Culture,"<a href="#page_062_note_57"><sup>57</sup></a> which I had
purchased. This book satisfied at once my character, my resolves, and my
<a name="page_063"></a> aspirations; and what hitherto lay isolated
within me was brought into ordered connection through its pages, while
ideas which possessed me without my perceiving them took definite form
and expression as the book brought them to light. Indeed, I thought then
that Arndt's book was the bible of education.</p>

<p>In those days I spoke of my life and my aims in the following words:
"I desire to educate men whose feet shall stand on God's earth, rooted
fast in Nature, while their head towers up to heaven, and reads its
secrets with steady gaze, whose heart shall embrace both earth and
heaven, shall enjoy the life of earth and nature with all its wealth of
forms, and at the same time shall recognise the purity and peace of
heaven, that unites in its love God's earth with God's heaven." In these
phrases I now see my former life and aims vividly brought before me as
in a picture.</p>

<p>Little by little a desire gained strength within me to free myself
from my engagement at the Model School, to which I had bound myself as
teacher for at least three years. The headmaster (Gruner), whom I have
already named, was sufficiently a student of men to have perceived that
so excitable a man as I could never work harmoniously in such an
institution as that which he directed; so I was released from my
engagement, under the condition that I should provide a suitable
successor. Fate was propitious to me once more. I found a young private
tutor with whom I had long been in friendly correspondence, and who had
all those qualities which were lacking in me. He was not only thoroughly
proficient in the grammar of his mother tongue (German), but also in the
grammar of the classical tongues; and, if I am not mistaken, in French
also. He had a knowledge of geography far beyond anything I could boast,
was acquainted with history, knew arithmetic, possessed some familiarity
with botany,&mdash;much greater, indeed, than I suspected. And what was
worth more than all this, he was full of vigour in mind, heart, and
life. Therefore the school was every way the gainer by my departure, so
greatly the gainer indeed, that from that time no further change has
been necessary. That same teacher still lives and works in that same
post.<a href="#page_063_note_58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="page_064"></a>Before I begin a new chapter of my career,
there are yet a few things which need mention.</p>

<p>To know French was at that time the order of the day, and not to know
it stamped a man at once as of a very low degree of culture. To acquire
a knowledge of French, therefore, became one of my chief aims at the
moment. It was my good fortune to obtain instruction from an unrivalled
teacher of French, M. Perrault, a Frenchman by birth, who still, even
though an old man, diligently worked at the study of his mother tongue,
and who at the same time wrote and spoke German with elegance. I pursued
the study with ardour, taking two lessons a day, because I desired to
reach a certain proficiency by a given time. Slow, however, were my
steps, for I was far from having a sufficient knowledge of my own tongue
whereon to build a bridge that might carry me into French. I never could
properly acquire what I did not fully understand in such a way that it
had a living meaning for me; and so from all the genuine zeal and
considerable cost which I spent over this study I gained by no means a
corresponding result; but I did learn a good deal, much more even than I
then knew how to turn to account. My teacher cast on one side all the
usual grammatical difficulties of French study, he aimed at imparting
the language as a living thing. But I with my ignorance of language
could not completely follow this free method of teaching; and yet,
nevertheless, I felt that the teacher had fully grasped the meaning and
the method of his work, and I always enjoyed the lessons on this
account. He was especially successful in accustoming my ear to the
French pronunciation, always separating and reducing it to its simple
sounds and tones, and never merely saying "this is pronounced like the
German <i>p</i>, or <i>b</i>, or <i>ä</i>, or <i>ö</i>," etc. The best thing resulting from
this course of study was the complete exposure of my ignorance of German
grammar. I must do myself the justice to say that I had given myself
extraordinary trouble over the works of the most celebrated German
grammarians, trying to bring life and interconnection or even a logical
consequence into German grammar; but I only confused myself the worse
thereby. One man said one thing, another quite the reverse; and not one
of all of them, as far as I could see, had educed his theories from <a
name="page_065"></a> the life and nature of the speech itself. I turned
away a second time, quite disheartened, from the German grammarians, and
once more took my own road. But unfortunately the dry forms of grammar
had, quite against my own will, stuck like scales over my eyes, dimming
my perceptions; I could find no means to rid myself of them, and they
wrought fatally upon me now and long afterwards. The more thoroughly I
knew them the more they stiffened and crushed me.</p>

<p>My departure from the school was now arranged, and I could let my
mind pursue its development free and unshackled. As heretofore, so now
also, my kindly fate came lovingly to my help: I can never speak of it
with sufficient thankfulness. The three lads to whom I had hitherto
given private instruction in arithmetic and language now needed a tutor,
as their former tutor was leaving them. The confidential charge was laid
upon me, because I of all men best knew their nature and its needs, of
seeking out some fit teacher and educator for them from amongst my
acquaintance. As for myself this tutor business lay far from my own
thoughts, and I therefore looked round me in every direction, and with
all earnestness, for some one else. Amongst others I applied to my
eldest brother, telling him my views as to the necessary requirements of
a true educator.</p>

<p>My brother wrote back very decidedly and simply, that he could not
propose any one to me as a teacher and educator who would fulfil the
requirements I had set forth, and further, he did not think I should
ever be able to find such a person; for if one should be found
possessing ample knowledge and experience of life in its external
aspects, he would be deficient in a vigorous inner life of his own, and
in the power to recognise and foster it in himself and his pupils; and,
on the other hand, another man who might have this power would be
deficient in the first-named (practical) qualities. I reported the
result of my labours. It caused much disappointment, indeed it could not
be otherwise, because the welfare of the children was really sought, in
all love and truth, and the highest and best obtainable at that day was
desired on their behalf. The family did not venture to press the post
upon me personally, knowing my love of freedom and independence.</p>

<p>So stood matters for several months. At last, moved by my <a
name="page_066"></a> earnest affection for the lads, and by my care to
deserve the confidence with which their mother had entrusted to my hands
the provision for their education, I endeavoured to look at things from
the point of view of their parents. This brought me at last to the
determination to become myself the educator and teacher of the lads.
After a hard struggle with myself, the hardest and most exhausting I had
undergone for a long time, I made known my decision. It was thankfully
received, and understood quite in the spirit which had actuated me in
forming it.</p>

<p>I communicated my decision to Gruner, with whom I still kept in the
friendliest relation. He looked at me with downright astonishment, and
said, "You will lose all hopes of the position you have so long sought
and waited for." I replied that I should protect myself as to my
position and my relations with others by a very definite written
contract. To which the man of experience retorted, "Certainly, and
everything will be punctually fulfilled, so that you cannot say that any
one condition of all those you stood out so firmly for has failed to be
observed; nevertheless you will find you will lose on all points." So
spake experienced shrewdness, and what had I to set against it? I spoke
of the educational necessities and wants of these children. "Good," said
he, "then you will leave your own educational necessities and your own
wants out of the question?" How it mortified me, that worldly wisdom
should be able to speak thus, and that I was unable to controvert it! We
talked no more about the matter.</p>

<p>And keen as was the internal conflict over this decision and this
resolve of mine, equally keen was the external contest which I had to
wage in entering on my new post.</p>

<p>There were, namely, two immutable conditions in our agreement. One
was that I should never be compelled to live in town with my pupils, and
that when I began my duties my pupils should be handed over entirely to
my care, without any restriction; that they should follow me into the
country, and there form a restricted and perfectly isolated circle, and
that when they returned to town life my duties as preceptor should be at
an end. The time for beginning my new career drew nigh. As the
stipulated dwelling for myself and my pupils was not yet ready, <a
name="page_067"></a> I was expected to take up my abode, for a few
days, with my pupils in their town house. But I felt that it was clear
that the least want of firmness at the outset would endanger my whole
educational plan; therefore, I stood firm, and indeed gained my point,
though at the price of being called headstrong, self-willed, and
stubborn. That my assumption of my post was attended with a sharp
contest was a very good and wholesome discipline for me. It was the
fitting inauguration of a position and a sphere of work which was
henceforth to be attended, for me, with perpetual and never-ending
strife.</p>

<p>But as to this family and all its members, my earnest unbending
maintenance of my resolve had a most wholesome effect upon them, even to
winning in the end their comprehension and approval, though this was
later and long after I had quitted the situation. It was ten or eleven
years afterwards&mdash;that is, four or five years after my
departure&mdash;that the mother of these lads expressed her entire
approval of the adamantine perseverance I had exhibited in my
convictions.</p>

<p>I entered my new sphere of educational work in July 1807. I was
twenty-five years old, as far as years went, but younger by several
years in regard to the development of my character. I neither felt
myself so old as I was, nor indeed had I any conception or realisation
of my age. I was only conscious of the strength and striving of my life,
the extent of my mental culture, the circumstances of my experience in
the world, and especially of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the
shiftlessness and undeveloped state of my culture as far as its
helplessness with the external world was concerned, of my ignorance of
life both as to what it really was, and how it showed in its outer
aspect. The state of my culture was such as only to serve to plunge me
into conflict, through the contradiction and opposition in which I found
myself henceforward with all existing methods; and consequently the
whole period of my tutorial career was one continual contest.</p>

<p>It was a salutary thing for me that this was my appointed lot from
the very beginning. Now and later on I was therefore able to say to
myself by way of consolation and encouragement: "You knew beforehand
just how it would be." Still, unpleasantness seldom arrives in exactly
the manner expected, and the unexpected <a name="page_068"></a> is
always the hardest to bear. Thus it was with me in this case; my
situation seemed to contain insurmountable difficulties. I sought the
basis for them in imperfect culture; and the cause of the disconnected
nature of the culture I had been able to attain, lay, so I perceived, in
the interruptions which marred my university career. Educator and
teacher, however, I had determined to become and to remain; and as far
as I could know my own feelings and my own powers, I must and would work
out my profession in an independent free fashion of my own, founded on
the view of man and his nature and relationships which had now begun to
dawn upon me. Yet every man finds it above all things difficult to
understand himself, and especially hard was it in my own case. I began
to think that I must look for help outside myself, and seek to acquire
from others the knowledge and experience I needed.</p>

<p>And thus there came to me once again the idea of fitting myself by
continuing my university studies to become founder, principal, and
manager of an educational establishment of my own. But the fact was to
be considered that I had turned away from the educational path on which
I had entered. Now, when the imperfection of my training pressed itself
upon me, I not only sought help from Nature as of old, that school
allotted to me by fate, but I turned also for assistance to my
fellow-men who had divided out the whole field of education and teaching
into separate departments of science, and had added to these the
assistance of a rich literature. This need of help so troubled and
oppressed me, and threw my whole nature into such confusion, that I
resolved, as soon as might be, once more to proceed to one of the
universities, and necessarily, therefore, to relinquish as speedily as
possible my occupation as an educator.</p>

<p>As I always discussed everything important with my brother, I wrote
to him on this occasion as usual, telling him of my plans and of my
resolve. But for this time, at least, my nature was able to work out its
difficulty without his help. I soon came to see that I had failed to
appreciate my position, and had misunderstood myself; and, therefore,
before I had time to get an answer from my brother to my first letter I
wrote to him again, telling him that my university plans had been given
up, and that my <a name="page_069"></a> fixed resolve now was to remain
at my post. He rejoiced doubly at my decision, because this time he
would have been unable to agree with me.<a
href="#page_069_note_59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>No sooner had I firmly come to my decision than I began to apply my
thoughts vigorously to the subjects of education and instruction. The
first thing that absorbed me was the clear conviction that to educate
properly one must share the life of one's pupil. Then came the
questions, "What is elementary education? and of what value are the
educational methods advocated by Pestalozzi? Above all, what is the
purpose of education?"</p>

<p>In answering the question, "What is the purpose of education?" I
relied at that time upon the following observations: Man lives in a
world of objects, which influence him, and which he desires to
influence; therefore he ought to know these objects in their nature, in
their conditions, and in their relations with each other and with
mankind. Objects have form, measurement, and number.</p>

<p>By the expression, "the external world," at this time I meant only
Nature; my life was so bound up in natural objects that I altogether
passed by the productions of man's art or manufacture. Therefore for a
long time it was an effort to me to regard man's handiwork, with
Pestalozzi's scholars, Tobler and Hopf, as a proper subject for
elementary culture, and it broadened my inward and outward glance
considerably when I was able to look upon the world of the works of man
as also part of the "external world." In this way I sought, to the
extent of such powers as I consciously possessed at that time, to make
clear the meaning of all things through man, his relations with himself,
and with the external world.</p>

<p>The most pregnant thought which arose in me at this period was this:
All is unity, all rests in unity, all springs from unity, strives for
and leads up to unity, and returns to unity at last. This striving in
unity and after unity is the cause of the several aspects of human life.
But between my inner vision and my outer perception, presentation, and
action was a great gulf fixed. <a name="page_070"></a> Therefore it
seemed to me that everything which should or could be required for human
education and instruction must be necessarily conditioned and given, by
virtue of the very nature of the necessary course of his development, in
man's own being, and in the relationships amidst which he is set. A man,
it seemed to me, would be well educated, when he had been trained to
care for these relationships and to acknowledge them, to master them and
to survey them.</p>

<p>I worked hard, severely hard, during this period, but both the
methods and the aims of education came before me in such an incoherent
heap, so split up into little fragments, and so entirely without any
kind of order, that during several years I did not make much progress
towards my constant purpose of bringing all educational methods into an
orderly sequence and a living unity. As my habitual and therefore
characteristic expression of my desires then ran, I longed to see, to
know, and to show forth, all things in inter-connection.</p>

<p>For my good fortune, however there came out about that time certain
educational writings by Seller,<a
href="#page_070_note_60"><sup>60</sup></a> Jean Paul,<a
href="#page_070_note_61"><sup>61</sup></a> and others. They supported
and elevated me, sometimes by their concurrence with my own views,
expressed above, sometimes by the very contrary.</p>

<p>The Pestalozzian method I knew, it is true, in its main principles,
but not as a living force, satisfying the needs of man. What especially
lay heavy upon me at this time, however, painfully felt by myself though
not apparent to my pupils, was the utter absence of any organised
connection between the subjects of education. Joyful and unfettered work
springs from the conception of all things as one whole, and forms a life
and a lifework <a name="page_071"></a> in harmony with the constitution
of the universe and resting firmly upon it.</p>

<p>That this was the true education I soon felt fervently convinced, and
so my first educational work consisted merely in being with my pupils
and influencing them by the power of my life and work; more than this I
was not at all in a position to give.</p>

<p>Oh, why is it that man knows so ill and prizes so little the
blessings that he possesses for the first time?</p>

<p>When I now seek to make myself clear as to the proper life and work
of an educator, my notes of that time rise fresh and fair to meet me. I
look back from now into that childhood of my teacher's life, and learn
from it; just as I look back into the childhood of my man's life, and
survey that, and learn from that, too. Why is all childhood and youth so
full of wealth and so unconscious of it, and why does it lose it without
knowing it only to learn what it possessed when it is for ever lost?
Ought this always to be so? Ought it to be so for every child, for every
youth? Will not a time come at last, come perhaps soon, when the
experience, the insight, the knowledge of age, and wisdom herself, shall
build up a defence, a shelter, a protection for the childhood of youth?
Of what use to mankind is the old man's experience and the greybeard's
wisdom when they sink into the grave with their possessors?</p>

<p>At first my life and my work with my pupils was confined within
narrow limits. It consisted in merely living, lounging, and strolling in
the open air, and going for walks. Although I was disgusted with the
methods of town education, I did not yet venture to convert life amidst
Nature into an educational course. That was taught me by my young pupils
themselves; and as from the circumstances of my own culture I eagerly
fostered to my utmost every budding sense for Nature that showed itself,
there soon developed amongst them a life-encompassing, life-giving, and
life-raising enjoyment of natural objects. In the following year<a
href="#page_071_note_62"><sup>62</sup></a> this way of life was further
enhanced by the father giving his sons a piece of meadowland for a
garden, at the cultivation of which we <a name="page_072"></a>
accordingly worked in common. The greatest delight of my pupils was to
make little presents of the produce of their garden to their parents and
also to me. How their eyes would gleam with pleasure when they were
fortunate enough to be able to accomplish this. Pretty plants and little
shrubs from the fields, the great garden of God, were transplanted by us
to the children's gardens, and there carefully tended. Great was the
joy, especially of the two younger ones, when such a colonist frankly
enrolled himself amongst the citizens of the state. From this time forth
my own childhood no longer seemed wasted. I acknowledged how entirely
different a thing is the cultivation of plants, to one who has watched
them and studied them in all the stages of their own free development,
from what it is to one who has always stood aloof from Nature.</p>

<p>And here already, living cheerfully and joyfully in the bosom of
Nature with my first pupils, I began to tell myself that the training of
natural life was closely akin to the training of human life. For did not
those gifts of flowers and plants express appreciation and
acknowledgment of the love of parents and teacher? Were they not the
outcome of the characteristic lovingness and the enthusiastic
thankfulness of childhood? A child that of its own accord and of its own
free will seeks out flowers, cares for them, and protects them, so that
in due time he can weave a garland or make a nosegay with them for his
parents or his teacher, can never become a bad child, a wicked man. Such
a child can easily be led towards love, towards thankfulness, towards
recognition of the fatherliness of God, who gives him these gifts and
permits them to grow that he, as a cheerful giver in his turn, may
gladden with them the hearts of his parents.</p>

<p>That time of conflict contained within it an element of special and
peculiar meaning to myself. It brought before me my past life in its
many various stages of development; and especially the chief events
which had formed and influenced it, with their causes and their effects.
And it always seemed to me of particular importance to go back upon the
very earliest occurrences in my life. But of the actual matters of fact
of my earliest years very few traces now remained; for my mother, who
could have kept them in her memory for me, and from whom I could now
have <a name="page_073"></a> learnt them, had died even before my life
had really awakened. Amongst the few relics remaining to me was a
written address from my godmother (the so-called Baptismal Letter),
which she had sent me immediately after my baptism, according to the
Thuringian custom of the time, as a sort of portion or dowry for my
entrance into life. It had come into my possession after the death of my
father. This letter, of a simple, Christian, tenderly religious, womanly
soul, expressed in plain and affecting terms the true relation of the
young Christian to that to which by his baptism he had become bound.
Through these words the inner life of both mind and soul, of my boyhood
and of my youth, was brought before me with all its peace and
blessedness; and I could not help seeing how much that I then longed for
had since come to pass. My soul, upon this thought, regained that
original inspiriting, enlightening, and quickening unity of which I
stood so much in need. But at the same time all the resolutions of my
boyhood and youth also rushed back upon me, and made it manifest how
much more had yet to happen before they, too, were accomplished; and
with them they brought the memory of those types and ideals with which
the feeble boyish imagination had sought to strengthen itself. But my
life had been far too much an inward and strictly personal life to have
been able, or even to have dared to stand forth in any outwardly
definite form, or to take any fixed relation to other lives, except in
matters of feeling and intelligence. Indeed the power of manifesting
myself properly was a very late accomplishment with me, and was, in
fact, not gained until long after the recommencement of my present
educational work.<a href="#page_073_note_63"><sup>63</sup></a> I cannot
now remember, during all the time of this educational work, that my
personal life stood out in any way from the usual ordinary existence of
men; but before I can speak with certainty upon this point I must
procure information as to the circumstances of my earlier life. This
much is clear, that my life at the time I am speaking of has remained in
my memory only in its general ordinary human aspect. It is true,
however, that then, as always <a name="page_074"></a> in my later life,
it was and ever has been very difficult to me to separate in thought my
inner life from my outer, and to give definite form and outward
expression to the inner life, especially as to religious matters.</p>

<p>I dare not deny, that although the definite religious forms of the
Church reached my heart readily both by way of the emotions and by
sincere conviction, and cleansed and quickened me, yet I have always
felt great reluctance to speak of these definite religious forms with
others, particularly with pupils and students. I could never make them
so clear and living to a simple healthy soul as they were to myself.
From this I conclude that the naturally trained child requires no
definite Church forms, because the lovingly-fostered, and therefore
continuously and powerfully-developed human life, as well as the
untroubled child-life also, is and must be in itself a Christian life. I
further conclude that a child to whom the deeper truths of life or of
religion were given in the dogmatic positive forms of Church creeds
would imperatively need when a young man to be surrounded by pure and
manly lives, whereby those rigid creeds might be illuminated and
quickened into life. Otherwise the child runs great danger of casting
away his whole higher life along with the dogmatic religious forms which
he has been unable to assimilate. There, indeed, is the most elevated
faith to be found, where form and life work towards a whole, shed light
upon each other, and go side by side in a sisterly concord, like the
inward life with the outward life, or the special with the
universal.</p>

<p>But I must return from this long digression, and resume the account
of my life and work as an educator.</p>

<p>Bodily exercises were as yet unknown to me in their educational
capacity. I was acquainted only with jumping over a cord and with
walking on stilts through my own boyish practice therein. As they fell
into no relation with our common life, neither with the pursuits and
thoughts of my pupils nor with my own, we regarded them purely as
childish games.</p>

<p>What the year brings to a man in the season when Nature lies clear
and open before him, that it does not bring to him in the season when
Nature is more often locked away from his gaze. And as the two seasons
bring diverse gifts, so do they require <a name="page_075"></a> diverse
things in return. In the latter part of the year, when man is perforce
driven more upon himself, his occupations should take on more narrowly
personal characteristics. Just as the winter's life with nature is more
fixed and narrowed, so also is the winter's life with men; therefore, a
boy's life at this time needs material of some definite fashion, or
needs fashionless material which can be shaped into definite fashion. My
pupils soon came to me, urged by this new necessity. What life requires
that life provides, wherever life is or has been; what youth requires
that youth provides, wherever youth is or has been. And what the later
man's life requires from a man, or from men in general, that also is
provided by the boy's life and the youth's life when these have been
genuinely lived through. The demand of my pupils set me upon the
following question: "What did you do as a boy? What happened to you to
satisfy that need of yours for something to do and to express? By what,
at the same period of your life, was this need most fully met, or what
did you then most desire for this purpose?" Then there came to me a
memory from out my earliest boyhood, which yielded me all I wanted in my
emergency. It was the easy art of impressing figures and forms by
properly arranged simple strokes on smooth paper.<a
href="#page_075_note_64"><sup>64</sup></a> I have often made use of this
simple art in my later life, and have never found it fail in its object;
and on this occasion, too, it faithfully served my pupils and me, for
our skill, at first weak both on the part of teacher and pupil, grew
rapidly greater with use.</p>

<p>From these forms impressed upon paper we rose to making forms out of
paper itself, and then to producing forms in paste-board, and finally in
wood. My later experience has taught me much more as to the best shapes
and materials for the study of forms,<a
href="#page_075_note_65"><sup>65</sup></a> of which I shall speak in its
proper place.</p>

<p>I must, however, permit myself to dwell a little upon this extremely
simple occupation of impressing forms on paper, because at the proper
age it quite absorbs a boy, and completely <a name="page_076"></a>
fills and contents the demands of his faculties. Why is this? It gives
the boy, easily and spontaneously, and yet at the same time
imperceptibly, precise, clear, and many-sided results due to his own
creative power.</p>

<p>Man is compelled not only to recognise Nature in her manifold forms
and appearances, but also to understand her in the unity of her inner
working, of her effective force. Therefore he himself follows Nature's
methods in the course of his own development and culture, and in his
games he imitates Nature at her work of creation. The earliest natural
formations, the fixed forms of crystals, seem as if driven together by
some secret power external to themselves; and the boy in his first games
gladly imitates these first activities of nature, so that by the one he
may learn to comprehend the other. Does not the boy take pleasure in
building, and what else are the earliest fixed forms of Nature but
built-up forms? However, this indication that a higher meaning underlies
the occupation and games which children choose out for themselves must
for the present suffice. And since these spontaneous activities of
children have not yet been thoroughly thought out from a high point of
view, and have not yet been regarded from what I might almost call their
cosmical and anthropological side, we may from day to day expect some
philosopher to write a comprehensive and important book about them.<a
href="#page_076_note_66"><sup>66</sup></a> From the love, the attention,
the continued interest and the cheerfulness with which these occupations
are plied by children other important considerations also arise, of
quite a different character.</p>

<p>A boy's game necessarily brings him into some wider or fuller
relationship, into relationship with some more elevated group of <a
name="page_077"></a> ideas. Is he building a house?&mdash;he builds it
so that he may dwell in it like grown-up people do, and have just such
another cupboard, and so forth, as they have, and be able to give people
things out of it just as they do. And one must always take care of this:
that the child who receives a present shall not have his nature cramped
and stunted thereby; according to the measure of how much he receives,
so much must he be able to give away. In fact, this is a necessity for a
simple-hearted child. Happy is that little one who understands how to
satisfy this need of his nature, to give by producing various gifts of
his own creation! As a perfect child of humanity, a boy ought to desire
to enjoy and to bestow to the very utmost, for he dimly feels already
that he belongs to the whole, to the universal, to the comprehensive in
Nature, and it is as part of this that he lives; therefore, as such
would he accordingly be considered and so treated. When he has felt
this, the most important means of development available for a human
being at this stage has been discovered. With a well-disposed child at
such a time nothing has any value except as it may serve for a common
possession, for a bond of union between him and his beloved ones. This
aspect of the child's character must be carefully noticed by parents and
by teachers, and used by them as a means of awakening and developing the
active and presentative side of his nature; wherefore none, not even the
simplest gifts from a child, should ever be suffered to be
neglected.</p>

<p>To sketch my first attempt as an educator in one phrase, I sought
with all my powers to give my pupils the best possible instruction, and
the best possible training and culture, but I was unable to fulfil my
intentions, to attain my end, in the position I then occupied, and with
the degree of culture to which I had myself attained.</p>

<p>As soon as this had become fully evident to me, it occurred to my
mind that nothing else could be so serviceable to me as a sojourn for a
time with Pestalozzi. I expressed my views on this head very decidedly,
and accordingly, in the summer of 1808, it was agreed that I should take
my three pupils with me to Yverdon.</p>

<p>So it soon afterwards came about I was teacher and scholar, educator
and pupil, all at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="page_078"></a>If I were to attempt to put into one sentence
all I expected to find at Yverdon, I should say it was a vigorous inner
life amongst the boys and youths, quickening, manifesting itself in all
kinds of creative activity, satisfying the manysidedness of man, meeting
all his necessities, and occupying all his powers both mental and
bodily. Pestalozzi, so I imagined, must be the heart, the life-source,
the spiritual guide of this life and work; from his central point he
must watch over the boy's life in all its bearings, see it in all its
stages of development, or at all events sympathise with it and feel with
it, whether as the life of the individual, of the family, of the
community, of the nation, of mankind at large.</p>

<p>With such expectations I arrived at Yverdon. There was no educational
problem whose resolution I did not firmly expect to find there. That my
soul soon faithfully mirrored the life which there flowed around me, my
report for 1809 sufficiently shows.<a
href="#page_078_note_67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>To throw myself completely into the midst, into the very heart, of
Pestalozzi's work, I wished to live in the main buildings of the
institution, that is to say, in the castle itself.<a
href="#page_078_note_68"><sup>68</sup></a> We would have cheerfully
shared the lot of the ordinary scholars, but our wish could not be
granted, some outside jealousies standing in the way. However, I soon
found a lodging, in immediate proximity to the institution, so that we
were able to join the pupils at their dinner, their evening meal, and
their supper, and to take part in the whole courses of their
instruction, so far as the subjects chosen by us were concerned; indeed,
to share in their whole life. I soon saw much that was imperfect; but,
notwithstanding, the activity which pressed forth on all sides, the
vigorous effort, the spiritual endeavour of the life around me, which
carried me away with it as it did all other men who came within its
influence, convinced me that here I should presently be able to resolve
all my difficulties. As far as regarded <a name="page_079"></a> myself
personally, I had nothing more earnest to do for the time than to watch
that my pupils gained the fullest possible profit from this life which
was so rich in vigour for both body and soul. Accordingly we shared all
lessons together; and I made it my special business to reason out with
Pestalozzi each branch of instruction from its first point of connection
with the rest, and thus to study it from its very root.</p>

<p>The forcible, comprehensive, stimulating life stimulated me too, and
seized upon me with all its comprehensiveness and all its force. It is
true it could not blind me to many imperfections and deficiencies, but
these were retrieved by the general tendency and endeavour of the whole
system; for this, though containing several absolute contradictions,
manifest even at that time, yet vindicated on a general view its inner
connection and hidden unity. The powerful, indefinable, stirring, and
uplifting effect produced by Pestalozzi when he spoke, set one's soul on
fire for a higher, nobler life, although he had not made clear or sure
the exact way towards it, nor indicated the means whereby to attain it.
Thus did the power and manysidedness of the educational effort make up
for deficiency in unity and comprehensiveness; and the love, the warmth,
the stir of the whole, the human kindness and benevolence of it replaced
the want of clearness, depth, thoroughness, extent, perseverance, and
steadiness. In this way each separate branch of education was in such a
condition as to powerfully interest, but never wholly to content the
observer, since it prepared only further division and separation and did
not tend towards unity.</p>

<p>The want of unity of effort, both as to means and aims, I soon felt;
I recognised it in the inadequacy, the incompleteness, and the
unlikeness of the ways in which the various subjects were taught.
Therefore I endeavoured to gain the greatest possible insight into all,
and became a scholar in all subjects&mdash;arithmetic, form, singing,
reading, drawing, language, physical geography, the natural sciences,
etc.</p>

<p>I could see something higher, and I believed in a higher efficiency,
a closer unity of the whole educational system; in truth, I believed I
saw this clearer, though not with greater conviction, than Pestalozzi
himself. I held that land happy, that <a name="page_080"></a> man
fortunate, by whom the means of true education should be developed and
applied, and the wish to see this benefit conferred upon my country
naturally sprang from the love I bore my native land.<a
href="#page_080_note_69"><sup>69</sup></a> The result was the written
record of 1809 already referred to.</p>

<p>Where there is the germ of disunion, where the whole is split up,
even sometimes into contradictory parts, and where an absolute
reconciling unity is wanting, where what connection there may be is
derived rather from casual outward ties than from inner necessary union,
the whole system must of necessity dig its own grave, and become its own
murderer. Now it was exactly at such a time of supreme crisis that I had
the good or the evil fortune to be at Yverdon. All that was good and all
that was bad, all that was profitable and all that was unprofitable, all
that was strong and all that was weak, all that was empty and all that
was full, all that was selfish and all that was unselfish amongst
Pestalozzi and his friends, was displayed openly before me.</p>

<p>I happened to be there precisely at the time of the great Commission
of 1810. Neither Pestalozzi nor his so-called friends, neither any
individuals nor the whole community, could give me, or would give me,
what I wanted. In the methods laid down by them for teaching boys, for
the thorough education of boys as part of one great human
family,&mdash;that is, for their higher instruction,&mdash;I failed to
find that comprehensiveness which is alone sufficient to satisfy the
human being. Thus it was with natural history, natural science, German,
and language generally, with history, and above all, with religious
instruction. Pestalozzi's devotional addresses were very vague, and, as
experience showed, were only serviceable to those already in the right
way.<a href="#page_080_note_70"><sup>70</sup></a> I spoke of all these
<a name="page_081"></a> things very earnestly and decidedly with
Pestalozzi, and at last I made up my mind, in 1810, to quit Yverdon
along with my pupils.</p>

<p>But before I continue further here, it is my duty to consider my life
and work from yet another point of view.</p>

<p>Amongst the various branches of education, the teaching of languages
struck me with especial force as defective, on account of its great
imperfection, its capriciousness and lifelessness. The search for a
satisfactory method for our native language occupied me in preference to
anything else. I proceeded on the following basis:&mdash;</p>

<p>Language is an image, a representation of our separate (subject)
world, and becomes manifest to the (object) world outside ourselves
principally through combined and ordered sounds. If, therefore, I would
image forth anything correctly, I must know the real nature of the
original object. The theme of our imagery and representation, the
outside world, contains objects, therefore I must have a definite form,
a definite succession of sounds, a definite word to express each object.
The objects have qualities, therefore our language must contain
adjectives expressing these qualities. The qualities of objects are
fundamental or relative; express what they are, what they possess, and
what they become.</p>

<p>Passing now to singing and music, it happened very luckily for me
that just at this time Nägeli and Pfeifer brought out their "Treatise on
the Construction of a Musical Course according to the Principles of
Pestalozzi." Nägeli's knowledge of music generally, and especially of
church music, made a powerful impression upon me, and brought music and
singing before me as a means for human culture; setting the cultivation
of music, and especially of singing, in a higher light than I had ever
conceived possible. Nägeli was very capable in teaching music and
singing, and in representing their function as inspiring aids to pure
human life; and although nearly twenty years have elapsed since I heard
those lessons of his, the fire of the love for music which they kindled
burns yet, active for good, within my breast. And further, I was taught
and convinced by these two super-excellent music teachers, who
instructed my pupils, that purely instrumental music, such as <a
name="page_082"></a> that of the violin or of the pianoforte, is also
in its essence based upon and derived from vocal music, though developed
through the independent discovery of a few simple sound-producing
instruments. Not only have I never since left the path thus opened to me
at its origin, but I have consistently traced it onwards in all care and
love, and continue to rejoice in the excellent results obtained. This
course of music-teaching, as extended and applied later on, has always
enjoyed the approbation of the thoughtful and experienced amongst music
teachers.</p>

<p>I also studied the boys' play, the whole series of games in the open
air, and learned to recognise their mighty power to awake and to
strengthen the intelligence and the soul as well as the body. In these
games and what was connected with them I detected the mainspring of the
moral strength which animated the pupils and the young people in the
institution. The games, as I am now fervently assured, formed a mental
bath of extraordinary strengthening-power;<a
href="#page_082_note_71"><sup>71</sup></a> and although the sense of the
higher symbolic meaning of games had not yet dawned upon me, I was
nevertheless able to perceive in each boy genuinely at play a moral
strength governing both mind and body which won my highest esteem.</p>

<p>Closely akin to the games in their morally strengthening aspect were
the walks, especially those of the general walking parties, more
particularly when conducted by Pestalozzi himself. These walks were by
no means always meant to be opportunities for drawing close to Nature,
but Nature herself, though unsought, always drew the walkers close to
her. Every contact with her elevates, strengthens, purifies. It is from
this cause that Nature, like noble great-souled men, wins us to her; and
whenever school or teaching duties gave me respite, my life at this time
was always passed amidst natural scenes and in communion with Nature.
From the tops of the high mountains near by I used to rejoice in the
clear and still sunset, in the pine-forests, the glaciers, the mountain
meadows, all bathed in rosy light. Such an evening walk <a
name="page_083"></a> came indeed to be an almost irresistible necessity
to me after each actively-spent day. As I wandered on the sunlit,
far-stretching hills, or along the still shore of the lake, clear as
crystal, smooth as a mirror, or in the shady groves, under the tall
forest trees, my spirit grew full with ideas of the truly god-like
nature and priceless value of a man's soul, and I gladdened myself with
the consideration of mankind as the beloved children of God. There is no
question but that Pestalozzi's general addresses, especially those
delivered in the evening, when he used to delight in evoking a picture
of noble manliness and true love of mankind and developing it in all its
details, very powerfully contributed towards arousing such an inner life
as that just described.</p>

<p>Yet I did not lose myself in empty fancies; on the contrary, I kept
my practical work constantly before my eyes. From thinking about my dead
parents my thoughts would wander back over the rest of my family,
turning most often to that dear eldest brother of mine, who has now not
been referred to for some time in these pages. He had become the
faithful watchful father of several children. I shared in his unaffected
fatherly cares, and my soul was penetrated with the desire that he might
be able to give his sons such an education as I should feel obliged to
point out to him as being the best. Already, ever since I was at
Frankfurt, I had communicated to him my thoughts on education and
methods of teaching. What now occurred to me out of my new knowledge as
applicable to his case, I extracted, collected together, and classified,
so as to be able to impart it to him for his use at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>One thing which greatly contributed to the better consideration and
elucidation of the Pestalozzian mode of teaching was the presence of a
large number of young men sent from various governments as students to
Yverdon. With some of these I was on terms of intimacy, and to the
exchange of ideas which went on amongst us I owe at least as much as to
my own observation.</p>

<p>On the whole I passed a glorious time at Yverdon, elevated in tone,
and critically decisive for my after life. At its close, however, I felt
more clearly than ever the deficiency of inner unity and
interdependence, as well as of outward comprehensiveness and
thoroughness in the teaching there.</p>

<p><a name="page_084"></a>To obtain the means of a satisfactory judgment
upon the best method of teaching the classical tongues, I took Greek and
Latin under a young German, who was staying there at that time; but I
was constructing a method of my own all the while, by observing all the
points which seemed valuable, as they occurred in actual teaching. But
the want of a satisfactory presentation of the classical tongues as part
of the general means of education and culture of mankind, especially
when added to the want of a consideration of natural history as a
comprehensive and necessary means of education, and above all the
uncertain wavering of the ground-principles on which the whole education
and teaching rested at Yverdon, decided me not only to take my pupils
back to their parents' house, but to abandon altogether my present
educational work, in order to equip myself, by renewed study at some
German university, with that due knowledge of natural science which now
seemed to me quite indispensable for an educator.</p>

<p>In the year 1810 I returned from Yverdon by Bern, Schaffhausen, and
Stuttgart to Frankfurt.</p>

<p>I should have prepared to go to the university at once, but found
myself obliged to remain at my post till the July of the following year.
The piece-meal condition of the methods of teaching and of education
which surrounded me hung heavy on my mind, so that I was extremely glad
when at last I was able to shake myself free from my position.</p>

<p>In the beginning of July 1811 I went to Göttingen. I went up at once,
although it was in the middle of the session, because I felt that I
should require several months to see my way towards harmonising my
inward with my outward life, and reconciling my thoughts with my
actions. And it was in truth several months before I gained peace within
myself, and before I arrived at that unity which was so necessary to me,
between my inward and my outward life, and at the equally necessary
harmony between aim, career, and method.</p>

<p>Mankind as a whole, as one great unity, had now become my quickening
thought. I kept this conception continually before my mind. I sought
after proofs of it in my little world within, and in the great world
without me; I desired by many a struggle to win it, and then to set it
worthily forth. And thus I <a name="page_085"></a> was led back to the
first appearance of man upon our earth, to the land which first saw man,
and to the first manifestation of mankind, his speech.</p>

<p>Linguistic studies, the learning of languages, philology, etc., now
formed the object of my attack. The study of Oriental tongues seemed to
me the central point, the fountain head, whither my search was leading
me; and at once I began upon them with Hebrew and Arabic. I had a dim
idea of opening up a path through them to other Asiatic tongues,
particularly those of India<a href="#page_085_note_72"><sup>72</sup></a>
and Persia. I was powerfully stimulated and attracted by what I had
heard about the study of these languages, then in its early
youth&mdash;namely, the acknowledgment of a relationship between Persian
and German. Greek also attracted me in quite a special way on account of
its inner fulness, organisation, and regularity. My whole time and
energy were devoted to the two languages I have named.<a
href="#page_085_note_73"><sup>73</sup></a> But I did not get far with
Hebrew in spite of my genuine zeal and my strict way with myself,
because between the manner of looking at a language congenial to my mind
and the manner in which the elementary lesson book presented it to me,
lay a vast chasm which I could find no means to bridge over. In the form
in which language was offered to me, I could find and see no means of
making it a living study; and yet, nevertheless, nothing would have
drawn me from my linguistic studies had I not been assured by educated
men that these studies, especially my work on Indian and Persian
tongues, were in reality quite beside the mark at which I aimed. Hebrew
also was abandoned; but, on the other hand, Greek irresistibly
enthralled me, and nearly all my time and energy were finally given to
its study, with the help of the best books.</p>

<p>I was now free, happy, in good mental and bodily health and vigour,
and I gained peace within myself and without, through hard work,
interrupted only by an indisposition which kept me to my room for a few
weeks. After working all day alone, I used to walk out late in the
evening, so that at least I might receive a greeting from the friendly
beams of the setting sun. To invigorate <a name="page_086"></a> my
spirit as well as my bodily frame I would walk on till near midnight in
the beautiful neighbourhood which surrounds Göttingen. The glittering
starry sky harmonised well with my thoughts, and a new object which
appeared in the heavens at this time, aroused my wonder in an especial
degree. I knew but little of astronomy, and the expected arrival of a
large comet<a href="#page_086_note_74"><sup>74</sup></a> was, therefore,
quite unknown to me; so that I found out the comet for myself, and that
was a source of special attraction. This object absorbed my
contemplation in those silent nights, and the thought of the
all-embracing, wide-spreading sphere of law and order above, developed
and shaped itself in my mind with especial force during my
night-wanderings. I often turned back home that I might note down in
their freshness the results of these musings; and then after a short
sleep I rose again to pursue my studies.</p>

<p>In this way the last half of the summer session passed quickly away,
and Michaelmas arrived.</p>

<p>The development of my inner life had meanwhile insensibly drawn me
little by little quite away from the study of languages, and led me
towards the deeper-lying unity of natural objects. My earlier plan
gradually reasserted itself, to study Nature in her first forms and
elements. But the funds which still remained to me were now too small to
permit of the longer residence at the university which that plan
necessitated. As I had nothing at all now to depend upon save my own
unaided powers, I at first thought to gain my object by turning them to
some practical account, such as literary work. I had already begun to
prepare for this, when an unexpected legacy changed my whole position.
Up to now I had had one aunt still living, a sister of my mother's, who
had spent all the best years of her life in my native village, enjoying
excellent health and free from care. By her sudden <a
name="page_087"></a> death I obtained, in a manner I had little
expected, the means of pursuing my much-desired studies. This occurrence
made a very deep impression upon me, because this lady was the sister of
that uncle of mine whose death had enabled me to travel from Gross
Milchow to Frankfurt, and so first set me upon my career as an educator.
And now again the death of a loved one made it possible for me to attain
higher culture in the service of this career. Both brother and sister
had loved with the closest affection my own mother, dead so far too
soon, and this love they had extended to her children after her. May
these two loving and beloved ones who through their death gave me a
higher life and a higher vocation, live for ever through my work and my
career.</p>

<p>My position was now a very pleasant one, and I felt soothing and
cheering influences such as had not visited me before.</p>

<p>In the autumn holidays, too, a friendly home was ready to receive me.
Besides the country-clergyman brother, who so often was a power for good
in my life, I had another brother, also older than I, who had been
living more than ten years as a well-established tradesman and citizen
in Osterode, amongst the Harz Mountains; head of a quiet,
self-contained, happy family, and father of some fine children. My
previous life and endeavours as an educator had already brought me into
connection with this circle; for I had not failed whenever I found
anything suitable to my brother's needs to let him know of it, as he was
the conscientious teacher and educator of his own children. It was in
this peaceful, active family-circle of an intellectual tradesman's home
that I passed all the vacation time during which the university
regulations released me from vigorous work. It could not prove otherwise
than that such a visit should be of the greatest service to me in my
general development, and I remember it with thankfulness even yet on
that account.</p>

<p>I return now to my university life. Physics, chemistry, mineralogy,
and natural history in general, were my principal studies.</p>

<p>The inner law and order embracing all things, and in itself
conditioned and necessitated, now presented itself to me in such
clearness that I could see nothing either in nature or in life in which
it was not made manifest, although varying greatly according <a
name="page_088"></a> to its several manifestations, in complexity and
in gradation. Just at this time those great discoveries of the French
and English philosophers became generally known through which the great
manifold external world was seen to form a comprehensive outer unity.
And the labours of the German and Swedish philosophers to express these
essentially conditioned fundamental laws in terms of weight and number,
so that they might be studied and understood in their most exact
expression, and in their mutual interchange and connection, fitted in
exactly with my own longings and endeavours. Natural science and natural
researches now seemed to me, while themselves belonging to a distinct
plane of vital phenomena, the foundation and cornerstones which served
to make clear and definite the laws and the progress of the development,
the culture, and the education of mankind.</p>

<p>It was but natural that such studies should totally absorb me, occupy
my whole energies, and keep me most busily employed. I studied chemistry
and physics with the greatest possible zeal, but the teaching of the
latter did not satisfy me so thoroughly as that of the former.</p>

<p>What in the current half-year's term I was regarding rather from a
theoretical standpoint, I intended in the next half-year to study
practically as a factor of actual life: hence I passed to organic
chemistry and geology.<a href="#page_088_note_75"><sup>75</sup></a>
Those laws which I was able to observe in Nature I desired to trace also
in the life and proceedings of man, wherefore I added to my previous
studies history, politics, and political economy. These practical
departments of knowledge brought vividly home to me the great truth that
the most valuable wealth a man can possess lies in a cultivated mind,
and in its suitable exercise upon matters growing out of its own natural
conditions. I saw further that wealth arose quite as much from vigour of
production as from saving by economical use; and that those productions
were the most valuable of all, which were the outcome and representation
of lofty ideas or remarkable thoughts; and finally, that politics itself
was in its essence but a means of uplifting man from the necessities of
Nature and of life to the freedom of the spirit and the will.</p>

<p><a name="page_089"></a>While I received much benefit from the
lectures on natural history at the university, I could not fall in with
the views held there as to fixed forms&mdash;crystallography,
mineralogy, and natural philosophy. From what I had heard of the natural
history lectures of Professor Weiss in Berlin, I felt sure that I could
acquire a correct view of both these subjects from him. And also since
my means would not allow me to stay even so long as one entire session
more at Göttingen, whilst on the other hand I might hope at Berlin to
earn enough by teaching to maintain a longer university career there, I
came to the conclusion to go to Berlin at the beginning of the next
winter session to study mineralogy, geology, and crystallography under
Weiss, as well as to do some work at physics and physical laws.</p>

<p>After a stay of a few weeks with my brother at Osterode, I went to
Berlin in October 1812.</p>

<p>The lectures for which I had so longed really came up to the needs of
my mind and soul, and awakened in me, more fervent than ever, the
certainty of the demonstrable inner connection of the whole cosmical
development of the universe. I saw also the possibility of man's
becoming conscious of this absolute unity of the universe, as well as of
the diversity of things and appearances which is perpetually unfolding
itself within that unity; and then, when I had made clear to myself, and
brought fully home to my consciousness, the view that the infinitely
varied phenomena in man's life, work, thought, feeling, and position,
were all summed up in the unity of his personal existence, I felt myself
able to turn my thoughts once more to educational problems.</p>

<p>To make sure of my power to maintain myself at the university, I
undertook some teaching at a private school of good reputation.<a
href="#page_089_note_76"><sup>76</sup></a> My work here, beyond the
sufficient support it afforded me during residence, had no positive
effect upon the endeavour of my life, for I found neither high
intelligence, lofty aims, nor unity in the course of instruction.</p>

<p><a name="page_090"></a>The fateful year 1813 had now begun. All men
grasped weapons, and called on one another to fly to arms to defend the
Fatherland. I, too, had a home, it is true, a birthplace, I might say a
Motherland, but I could not feel that I had a Fatherland.<a
href="#page_090_note_77"><sup>77</sup></a> My home sent up no cry to me;
I was no Prussian,<a href="#page_090_note_78"><sup>78</sup></a> and thus
it came about that the universal call to arms (in Berlin) affected me,
in my retired life, but little. It was quite another sentiment which
drew me to join the ranks of German soldiers; my enthusiasm was possibly
small, but my determination was firmly fixed as the rocks
themselves.</p>

<p>This sentiment was the consciousness of a pure German brotherhood,
which I had always honoured in my soul as a lofty and sublime ideal; one
which I earnestly desired might make itself felt in all its fulness and
freedom all over Germany.</p>

<p>Besides the fidelity with which I clung to my avocation as an
educator also influenced my action in this matter. Even if I could not
say truly that I had a Fatherland, I must yet acknowledge that every
boy, that every child, who might perhaps later on come to be educated by
me would have a Fatherland, that this Fatherland was now requiring
defence, and that the child was not in a position to share in that
defence. It did not seem possible to imagine that a young man capable of
bearing arms could become a teacher of children and boys whose
Fatherland he had refused to defend with his blood and even with his
life if need were; that he who now did not feel ashamed to shrink from
blows could exist without blushing in after years, or could incite his
pupils to do something noble, something calling for sacrifice <a
name="page_091"></a> and for unselfishness, without exposing himself to
their derision and contempt. Such was the second main reason which
influenced me.</p>

<p>Thirdly, this summons to war seemed to me an expression of the
general need of the men, the land, and the times amidst which I lived,
and I felt that it would be altogether unworthy and unmanly to stand by
without fighting for this general need, and without taking my share in
warding off the general danger.</p>

<p>Before these convictions all considerations gave way, even that of my
bodily constitution, which was far too weakly for such a life.</p>

<p>As comrades I selected the Lützowers; and at Eastertide 1813 I
arrived at Dresden on my road to join the infantry division of Lützow's
corps at Leipzig.<a href="#page_091_note_79"><sup>79</sup></a> Through
the retired nature of my self-concentrated life it came about naturally
that I, although a regularly matriculated student, had held aloof from
the other students, and had gained no settled acquaintance amongst them;
thus, out of all the vigorous comrades whom I met at Dresden, many of
whom were like myself, Berlin students, I did not find one man I knew. I
made but few new friends in the army, and these few I was fated to
encounter on the first day of my entrance into my new work of
soldiering. Our sergeant at the first morning halt after our march out
from Dresden, introduced me to a comrade from Erfurt as a Thüringer, and
therefore a fellow-countryman. This was Langethal; and casually as our
acquaintance <a name="page_092"></a> thus began, it proved to be a
lasting friendship. Our first day's march was to Meissen, where we
halted. We had enjoyed lovely spring weather during our march, and our
repose was gladdened by a still lovelier evening. I found all the
university students of the corps, driven by a like impulse, collected
together in an open place by the shores of Elbe and near a public
restaurant; and some old Meissen wine soon served us as a bond of union.
We sat about twenty strong in a jolly group at a long table, and began
by welcoming and pledging one another to friendship. It was here that
Langethal introduced me to a university friend of his at Berlin, the
young Middendorff, a divinity student from the Mark.<a
href="#page_092_note_80"><sup>80</sup></a> Keeping together in a merry
little society till the middle of the lovely spring night, we united
again next morning in a visit to the splendid cathedral of Meissen. Thus
from the very first did we three join fast in a common struggle towards
and on behalf of the higher life, and even if we have not always
remained in the like close outward bonds of union, we have from that
time to this, now near upon fifteen years, never lost our comradeship in
the inner life and our common endeavour after self-education. Both
Langethal and Middendorff had a third friend, named Bauer, amongst our
comrades of the camp. With him also, as I think, I made acquaintance as
early as at Meissen, but it was more particularly at Havelberg, later
on, that Bauer and I struck up a friendship together, which has ever
since endured. Even when we have not been together in outward life, we
have always remained one in our endeavours after the highest and best.
<a name="page_093"></a> Bauer closed the narrow circle of my friends
amongst our companions in arms.<a
href="#page_093_note_81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>I remained true to my previous way of life and thought in the manner
in which I viewed my new soldier life. My main care was always to
educate myself for the actual calling which at the moment I was
following; thus, amongst the first things I took in hand was an attempt
at finding the inner necessity and connection of the various parts of
the drill and the military services, in which, without any previous
acquaintance with military affairs, I managed, in consequence of my
mathematical and physical knowledge, to succeed very fairly and without
any great difficulty. I was able to protect myself, therefore, against
many small reprimands, which fell tolerably frequently on those who had
thought this or that instruction might be lightly passed over as too
trivial to be attended to. It came about in this way, when we were
continually drilling, after the cessation of the armistice, that the
military exercises we performed gave me genuine pleasure on account of
their regularity, their clearness, and the precision of their execution.
In probing into their nature I could see freedom beneath their
recognised necessity.</p>

<p>During the long sojourn of our corps in Havelberg previously alluded
to, I strengthened my inner life, so far as the military service
permitted, by spending all the time I could in the open <a
name="page_094"></a> air, in communion with Nature, to a perception of
whose loveliness a perusal of G. Forster's "Travels in Rhineland" had
newly unlocked my senses.<a
href="#page_094_note_82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>We friends took all opportunities of meeting one another. By-and-by
we set to work to make this easier by three of us applying to be
quartered together.</p>

<p>In the rough, frank life of war, men presented themselves to me under
various aspects, and so became a special object of my thoughts as
regards their conduct, and their active work, and most of all as to
their higher vocation. Man and the education of man was the subject
which occupied us long and often in our walks, and in our open-air life
generally. It was particularly these discussions which drew me forcibly
towards Middendorff, the youngest of us.</p>

<p>I liked well our life of the bivouac, because it made so much of
history clear to me; and taught me, too, through our oft-continued and
severely laborious marches and military man&oelig;uvres, the
interchanging mutual relations of body and spirit. It showed me how
little the individual man belongs to himself in war time; he is but an
atom in a great whole, and as such alone must he be considered.</p>

<p>Through the chance of our corps being far removed from the actual
seat of war, we lived our soldier life, at least I did, in a sort of
dream, notwithstanding the severe exertions caused by our military
man&oelig;uvres, and we heard of the war only in the same sleepy way.
Now and then, at Leipzig, at Dalenburg, at Bremen, <a
name="page_095"></a> at Berlin, we seemed to wake up; but soon sank
back into feeble dreaminess again. It was particularly depressing and
weakening to me never to be able to grasp our position as part of the
great whole of the campaign, and never to find any satisfactory
explanation of the reason or the aim of our man&oelig;uvres. That was my
case at least; others may have seen better and clearer than I.</p>

<p>I gained one clear benefit from the campaign; in the course of the
actual soldier life I became enthusiastic upon the best interests of the
German land and the German people; my efforts tended to become national
in their scope. And in general, so far as my fatigues allowed, I kept
the sense of my future position always before me; even in the little
skirmishes that we had to take part in I was able to gather some
experiences which I saw would be useful to me in my future work.</p>

<p>Our corps marched through the Mark,<a
href="#page_095_note_83"><sup>83</sup></a> and in the latter part of
August through Priegnitz, Mecklenburg, the districts of Bremen and
Hamburg, and Holstein, and in the last days of 1813 we reached the
Rhine. The peace (May 30th, 1814) prevented us from seeing Paris, and we
were stationed in the Netherlands till the breaking up of the corps. At
last, in July 1814, every one who did not care to serve longer had
permission to return to his home and to his former calling. Upon my
entrance into a corps of Prussian soldiers I had received, through the
influence of some good friends, the promise of a post under the Prussian
Government&mdash;namely, that of assistant at the mineralogical museum
of Berlin, under Weiss. Thither then, as the next place of my destined
work, I turned my steps. I desired also to see the Rhine and the Main,
and my birthplace as well; so I went by Dusseldorf back to Lünen, and
thence by Mainz, Frankfurt, and Rudolstadt to Berlin.</p>

<p>Thus I had lived through the whole campaign according to my strength,
greater or less, in a steady inner struggle towards unity and harmony of
life, but what of outward significance and worth recollection had I
received from the soldier's life? I left the army and the warlike career
with a total feeling of discontent. My inner yearning for unity and
harmony, for inward peace, <a name="page_096"></a> was so powerful that
it shaped itself unconsciously into symbolical form and figure. In a
ceaseless, inexplicable, anxious state of longing and unrest, I had
passed through many pretty places and many gardens on my homeward way,
without any of them pleasing me. In this mood I reached F&mdash;&mdash;,
and entered a fairly large and handsomely-stocked flower garden. I gazed
at all the vigorous plants and fresh gay flowers it offered me, but no
flower took my fancy. As I passed all the many varied beauties of the
garden in review before my mind, it fell upon me suddenly that I missed
the lily. I asked the owner of the garden if he had no lilies there, and
he quietly replied, <i>No</i>! When I expressed my surprise, I was answered
as quietly as before that hitherto no one had missed the lily. It was
thus that I came to know what I missed and longed for. How could my
inner nature have expressed itself more beautifully in words? "Thou art
seeking silent peacefulness of heart, harmony of life, clear purity of
soul, by the symbol of this silent, pure, simple lily." That garden, in
its beautiful variety, but without a lily, appeared to me as a gay life
passed through and squandered without unity and harmony. Another day I
saw many lovely lilies blooming in the garden of a house in the country.
Great was my joy; but, alas! they were separated from me by a hedge.
Later on I solved this symbol also; and until its solution image and
longing remained stored in my memory. One thing I ought to
notice&mdash;namely, that in the place where I was vainly seeking for
lilies in the garden a little boy of three years old came up trustfully
and stood by my side.</p>

<p>I hastened to the scene of my new duties. How variously the different
outward circumstances of my life henceforth affected me as to the life
within, now that this had won for itself once more an assured individual
form, and how my life again resumed its true and highest aspect, I must
pass over here, since to develop these considerations with all their
connections would take me too long.</p>

<p>In the first days of August 1814 I arrived at Berlin, and at once
received my promised appointment. My duties busied me the greater part
of the day amongst minerals, dumb witnesses to the silent thousand-fold
creative energy of Nature, and I had <a name="page_097"></a> to see to
their arrangement in a locked, perfectly quiet room. While engaged on
this work I continually proved to be true what had long been a
presentiment with me&mdash;namely, that even in these so-called lifeless
stones and fragments of rock, torn from their original bed, there lay
germs of transforming, developing energy and activity. Amidst the
diversity of forms around me, I recognised under all kinds of various
modifications one law of development.</p>

<p>All the points that in Göttingen I had thought I traced amidst
outward circumstances, confirmatory of the order of the soul's
development, came before me here also, in a hundred and again a hundred
phenomena. What I had recognised in things great or noble, or in the
life of man, or in the ways of God, as serving towards the development
of the human race, I found I could here recognise also in the smallest
of these fixed forms which Nature alone had shaped. I saw clearly, as
never yet I had seen before, that the godlike is not alone in the great;
for the godlike is also in the very small, it appears in all its fulness
and power in the most minute dimensions. And thereafter my rocks and
crystals served me as a mirror wherein I might descry mankind, and man's
development and history. These things began to stir powerfully within
me; and what I now vaguely perceived I was soon to view more definitely,
and to be able to study with thoroughness.</p>

<p>Geology and crystallography not only opened up for me a higher circle
of knowledge and insight, but also showed me a higher goal for my
inquiry, my speculation, and my endeavour. Nature and man now seemed to
me mutually to explain each other, through all their numberless various
stages of development. Man, as I saw, receives from a knowledge of
natural objects, even because of their immense deep-seated diversity, a
foundation for, and a guidance towards, a knowledge of himself and of
life, and a preparation for the manifestation of that knowledge. What I
thus clearly perceived in the simpler natural objects I soon traced in
the province of living Nature, in plants and growing things, so far as
these came under my observation, and in the animal kingdom as well.</p>

<p>Soon I became wholly penetrated and absorbed by the thought that it
must be beyond everything else vital to man's culture and development,
to the sure attainment of his destiny and fulfilment <a
name="page_098"></a> of his vocation, to distinguish these tendencies
accurately and sharply not only in their separate ascending grades, but
also throughout the whole career of life. Moreover, I made a resolution
that for some time I would devote myself to the study of the higher
methods of teaching, so as to fit myself as a teacher in one of the
higher centres of education, as, for example, one of the universities,
if that might be. But it was not long before I found a double
deficiency, which quickly discouraged me in this design. For, firstly, I
wanted a fund of specially learned and classical culture; and next, I
was generally deficient in the preparatory studies necessary for the
higher branches of natural science. The amount of interest in their work
shown by university students was, at the same time, not at all serious
enough to attract me to such a career.</p>

<p>I soon perceived a double truth: first, that a man must be early led
towards the knowledge of nature and insight into her methods&mdash;that
is, he must be from the first specially trained with this object in
view; and next, I saw that a man, thus led through all the due stages of
a life-development should in order to be quite sure to accomplish in all
steadiness, clearness, and certainty his aim, his vocation, and his
destiny, be guarded from the very beginning against a crowd of
misconceptions and blunders. Therefore I determined to devote myself
rather to the general subject of the education of man.</p>

<p>Though the splendid lectures I heard on mineralogy, crystallography,
geology, etc., led me to see the uniformity of Nature in her working,
yet a higher and greater unity lay in my own mind. To give an example,
it was always most unsatisfactory to me to see form developed from a
number of various ground-forms. The object which now lay before my
efforts and my thought was to bring out the higher unity underlying
external form in such a self-evident shape that it should serve as a
type or principle whence all other forms might be derived. But as I held
the laws of form to be fixed, not only for crystals, but also just as
firmly for language, it was more particularly a deep philosophical view
of language which eventually absorbed my thoughts. Again, ideas about
language which I had conceived long ago in Switzerland crowded before my
mind. It seemed to me that the vowels <a name="page_099"></a> <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>u</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>ä</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>ei</i>, resembled, so to speak, force, spirit,
the (inner) subject, whilst the consonants symbolised matter, body, the
(outer) object. But just as in life and in nature all opposites are only
relatively opposed, and within every circle, every sphere, both
opposites are found to be contained, so also in language one perceives
within the sphere of speech-tones the two opposites of subject and
object. For example, the sound <i>i</i> depicts the absolute subject, the
centre, and the sound <i>a</i> the absolute material object; the sound <i>e</i>
serves for life as such, for existence in general; and <i>o</i> for
individual life, for an existence narrowed to itself alone.</p>

<p>Language, not alone as the material for the expression of thought,
but also as a type or epitome of all forms and manifestations of life,
appeared to me to underlie the universal laws of expression. In order to
learn these laws thoroughly, as exemplified in the teaching of the
classical languages, I now returned again to the study of these latter,
under the guidance of a clever teacher; and I began to strike out the
special path which seemed to me absolutely necessary to be followed in
their acquisition.</p>

<p>From this time onwards I gave all my thoughts to methods of
education, whereto I was also further incited by some keen critical
lectures on the history of ancient philosophy. These again afforded me a
clear conviction of the soundness of my views of Nature and of the laws
of human development.</p>

<p>Through my work at the dynamical, chemical, and mathematical aspects
of Nature I came once more upon the consideration of the laws of number,
particularly as manifested through figures; and this led me to a
perfectly fresh general view of the subject&mdash;namely, that number
should be regarded as horizontally related.<a
href="#page_099_note_84"><sup>84</sup></a> That way of considering the
subject leads one to very simple fundamental conceptions of arithmetic,
which, when applied in practice, prove to be as accurate as they are
clear. The connection <a name="page_100"></a> of these (dynamical and
arithmetical) phenomena was demonstrably apparent to me; since
arithmetic may be considered, firstly, as the outward expression of the
manifestation of force, secondly (in its relationship to man), as an
example of the laws of human thought.</p>

<p>On all sides, through nature as well as through history, through life
as well as through science (and as regards the latter through pure
science as well as through the applied branches), I was thus encountered
and appealed to by the unity, the simplicity, and the unalterably
necessary course, of human development and human education. I became
impelled by an irresistible impulse towards the setting forth of that
unity and simplicity, with all the force, both of my pen and of my life,
in the shape of an educational system. I felt that education as well as
science would gain by what I may call a more human, related, affiliated,
connected treatment and consideration of the subjects of education.</p>

<p>I was led to this conviction on another ground, as
follows:&mdash;Although my friends Langethal, Middendorff, and Bauer
served with me all through the war in the same corps, and even in the
same battalion, we were a great deal apart towards the close of the
campaign, especially at the time we were quartered in the Netherlands,
so that I, at all events, at the disbanding of the corps, knew not
whither the others had gone. It was, therefore, an unexpected pleasure
when, after a while, I found them all at Berlin again. My friends
pursued their theological studies with earnestness, and I my natural
science; therefore, at first we came little into contact with one
another.</p>

<p>So passed several months, when suddenly life threw us closer together
again. This came about through the call to arms in 1815. We all enlisted
again together as volunteers. On account of our previous service, and by
royal favour, we were at once promoted to officer's rank, and each one
was appointed to a regiment. However, there was such a throng of
volunteers that it was not necessary for any State officials to be
called upon to leave their posts, or for students to interrupt their
studies, and we therefore received counter-orders commanding us to stay
at home. Middendorff, who felt sure of his speedy departure for the
army, <a name="page_101"></a> preferred not to take lodgings for the
short time of his stay in Berlin, and as there was room enough in mine
for us both, he came and stayed with me. Yet we still seemed to draw
very little closer together at first, because of the diversity of our
pursuits; but soon a bond of union wove itself again, which was all the
stronger on that very account. Langethal and Middendorff had endeavoured
to secure a sufficiency for their support at the university by taking
private tutorships in families, making such arrangements as that their
university studies should not be interfered with. In the beginning of
their work all seemed simple and easy, but they soon came upon
difficulties both as regards the teaching and the training of the
children entrusted to them. As our former conversations had so often
turned upon these very subjects they now came to me to consult me,
especially about mathematical teaching and arithmetic, and we set apart
two hours a week, in which I gave them instruction on these matters.
From this moment our mutual interchange of thought again became animated
and continuous.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="page_102"></a>Here the autobiography breaks off abruptly.
Herr Wichard Lange had some trouble in deciphering it from Froebel's
almost unreadable rough draft, and here and there he had even to guess
at a word or so. Froebel had intended to present this letter to the Duke
of Meiningen at the close of 1827, when the negotiations began to be
held about a proposed National Educational Institution at Helba, to be
maintained by the duke, after the similar proposal made to the Prince of
Rudolstadt for Quittelsdorf earlier in the year had broken down. It is
not known whether the present draft was ever finished, properly
corrected, and polished into permanent form, nor whether it was ever
delivered to the duke. It is highly probable that we have here all that
Froebel accomplished towards it. It may be added that soon after
Froebel's repeated plans and drafts for the Helba Institution had
culminated in the final extensive well-known plan of the spring of 1829,
the whole scheme fell through, from the jealousy of the prince's
advisers, who feared Froebel's influence too much to allow him ever to
get a footing amongst them.</p>

<p>Another fragment of autobiography, going on to a further period of
his life, occurs in a long letter to the philosopher Krause,<a
href="#page_102_note_85"><sup>85</sup></a> dated Keilhau, 24th March,
1828, in reply to an article written by Krause five years before (1823)
in Oken's journal, the well-known <i>Isis</i><a
href="#page_102_note_86"><sup>86</sup></a> in which article Krause had
found fault with Froebel's two explanatory essays on Keilhau, written in
1822, separately published, and appearing also in the <i>Isis</i>, because
Keilhau was there put forward as "an educational institution for all
Germany" (Allgemeine Deutsche Erziehungs-Anstalt), whereas Krause
desired it should rather style itself "a German institution for
universal <a name="page_103"></a> culture" (Deutsche Anstalt für
Allgemeine menschliche Bildung). The rapid growth of Keilhau gave
Froebel at the time no leisure for controversy. In 1827 began the cruel
persecutions which eventually compelled him to leave Keilhau. Now
whenever Froebel was under the pressure of outward difficulty, he always
sought for help from within, and from his inward contemplation derived
new courage and new strength to face his troubles. Out of such musings
in the present time of adversity the long-awaited reply to Krause at
length emerged. The disputative part, interesting in itself, does not
here concern us. We pass at once to the brief sketch of his life
contained in later parts of the letter, omitting what is not
autobiographical. The earlier of these passages relate more succinctly
the events of the same period already more fully described in the letter
to the Duke of Meiningen; but we think it better to print the passages
in full, in spite of their being to a great extent a repetition of what
has gone before. Certain differences, however, will be found not
unworthy of notice.</p>

<p>The Krause letter succeeded the other and more important letter (to
the Duke of Meiningen) by some few months. Its immediate outcome was a
warm friendship between Krause and Froebel; the latter, with Middendorff
as his companion, journeying to Göttingen to make the philosopher's
personal acquaintance, in the autumn of 1828. Long discussions on
education took place at this interesting meeting, as we know from
Leonhardi, Krause's pupil. Krause made Froebel acquainted with the works
of Comenius, amongst other things, and introduced him to the whole
learned society of Göttingen, where he made a great, if a somewhat
peculiar, impression.</p>





<center><h5><a name="page_104"></a>PART OF FROEBEL'S LETTER TO KRAUSE,
DATED KEILHAU, 24TH MARCH, 1828.</h5></center>


<p>... You have enjoyed, without doubt, unusual good fortune in having
pursued the strict path of culture. You have sailed by Charybdis without
being swallowed up by Scylla.<a
href="#page_104_note_87"><sup>87</sup></a> But my lot has been just the
reverse.</p>

<p>As I have already told you in the beginning of this letter, I was
very early impressed with the contradictions of life in word and
deed&mdash;in fact, almost as soon as I was conscious of anything,
living as a lonely child in a very narrowed and narrowing circle. A
spirit of contemplation, of simplicity, and of childlike faith; a stern,
sometimes cruel, self-repression; a carefully-fostered inward yearning
after knowledge by causes and effects, together with an open-air life
amidst Nature, especially amidst the world of plants, gradually freed my
soul from the oppression of these contradictions. Thus, in my tenth and
eleventh years, I came to dream of life as a connected whole without
contradictions. Everywhere to find life, harmony, freedom from
contradictions, and so to recognise with a keener and clearer perception
the life-unity after which I dimly groped, was the silent longing of my
heart, the mainspring of my existence. But the way thither through the
usual school course, all made up of separate patches, considering things
merely in their outward aspect, and connected by mere arbitrary
juxtaposition, was too lifeless to attract me; I could not remember
things merely put together without inner connection, and so it came
about that after two of my elder brothers had devoted themselves to
study, and because my third brother showed great capacity for study
also, my own education was narrowed; <a name="page_105"></a> but so
much the more closely did a loving, guiding providence bind my heart in
communion with Nature.<a href="#page_105_note_88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>In silent, trustful association with Nature and my mathematics, I
lived for several years after my confirmation. In the latter part of the
time my duties led me towards the study of natural laws, and thus
towards the perception of the unity so often longed for in soul and
spirit, and now at last gradually becoming clear from amidst the
outwardly clashing phenomena of Nature.<a
href="#page_105_note_89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>At last I could no longer resist the craving for knowledge which I
felt within me. I thrust on one side all the ordinary school-learning
which I utterly failed to appropriate in its customary disconnected
state (it was meant only to be learned by rote, and this I never could
recognise as the exclusive condition of a really comprehensive culture
of the human mind), and I went up in the middle of my eighteenth year to
the University of Jena. As I had been for two years past living
completely with Nature and my mathematics, and dependent upon myself
alone for any culture I might have arrived at, I came to the university
much like a simple plant of nature myself. I was at this time peculiarly
moved by a little knowledge I had picked up about the solar system,
including particularly a general conception of Kepler's laws, whereby
the laws of the spheres appealed to me on the one hand as an
all-embracing, world-encircling whole, and on the other as an unlimited
individualisation into separate natural objects. My own culture had been
hitherto left to myself, and so also now I had to select my own studies
and to choose my courses of lectures for myself. It was to be expected
that the lectures of <a name="page_106"></a> the professors would
produce a singular effect upon me, and so they did.</p>

<p>I chose as my courses natural history, physics, and mathematics, but
I was little satisfied. I seldom gained what I expected. Everywhere I
sought for a sound method deriving itself from the fundamental principle
lying at the root of the subject in hand, and afterwards summing up all
details into that unity again; everywhere I sought for recognition of
the quickening interconnection of parts, and for the exposition of the
inner all-pervading reign of law. Only a few lectures made some poor
approach to such methods, but I found nothing of the sort in those which
were most important to me, physics and mathematics. Especially repugnant
to me was the piece-meal patchwork offered to us in geometry, always
separating and dividing, never uniting and consolidating.</p>

<p>I was, however, perfectly fascinated with the mathematical rules of
"combination, permutation, and variation," but unhappily I could not
give much time to their study, which I have regretted ever since.
Otherwise, what I learned from the lectures was too slight for what I
wanted, being, unluckily, altogether foreign to my nature, and more
often a mere getting of rules by heart rather than an unfolding of
principles. The theoretical and philosophical courses on various
subjects did not attract me either, something about them always kept me
at a distance; and from what I heard of them amongst my fellow-students,
I could gather that here, too, all was presented in an arbitrary
fashion, unnaturally divided, cut up, so to speak, into lifeless
morsels; so that it was useless for my inner life to seek for
satisfaction in those regions of study. But as I said above, there were
some of the lectures which fostered my interest in the inner connection
of all vital phenomena, and even helped me to trace it with some
certainty in some few restricted circles.</p>

<p>But my financial position did not permit me to remain long at the
university; and as my studies were those which fitted the student for
practical professional life, though they were regarded from a higher
point of view by myself in the privacy of my own thoughts, I had to
return to ordinary every-day work, and use them as a means to earn my
living. Yet, though I lived the outward business life to all appearance,
it remained ever foreign <a name="page_107"></a> to my nature; I
carried my own world within me, and it was that for which I cared and
which I cherished. My observation of life (and especially that of my own
life, which I pursued with the object of self-culture), joined with the
love of Nature and with mathematics to work creatively upon me; and they
united to fill my little mental world with many varied life-forms, and
taught me at the same time to regard my own existence as one member of
the great universal life. My plan of culture was very simple: it was to
seek out the innermost unity connecting the most diverse and
widely-separated phenomena, whether subjective or objective, and whether
theoretical or practical, to learn to see the spiritual side of their
activity, to apprehend their mutual relations as facts and forms of
Nature, or to express them mathematically; and, on the other hand, to
contemplate the natural and mathematical laws as founded in the
innermost depths of my own life as well as in the highest unity of the
great whole, that is indeed to regard them in their unconditioned,
uncaused necessity, as "absolute things-in-themselves." Thus did I
continue without ceasing to systematise, symbolise, idealise, realise
and recognise identities and analogies amongst all facts and phenomena,
all problems, expressions, and formulas which deeply interested me; and
in this way life, with all its varied phenomena and activities, became
to me more and more free from contradictions, more harmonious, simple,
and clear, and more recognisable as a part of the life universal.</p>

<p>After I had lived for some years the isolated life I have described,
though I was engaged the whole time in ordinary professional pursuits,
all at once there broke upon my soul, in harmony with the seasons of
nature, a springtime such as I had not before experienced; and an
unexpected life and life-aim budded and blossomed in my breast. All my
inner life and life-aims had become narrowed to the circle of
self-culture and self-education. The outer life, my profession, I
carried on as a mere means of subsistence, quite apart from my real
inner self, and my sphere of operation was limited. I was driven
perforce from pillar to post till at last I had arrived where the Main
unites herself with the Rhine.<a
href="#page_107_note_90"><sup>90</sup></a> Here there budded and opened
to my soul one lovely <a name="page_108"></a> bright spring morning,
when I was surrounded by Nature at her loveliest and freshest, this
thought, as it were by inspiration:&mdash;That there must exist
somewhere some beautifully simple and certain way of freeing human life
from contradiction, or, as I then spake out my thought in words, some
means of restoring to man, himself, at peace internally; and that to
seek out this way should be the vocation of my life. And yet my life, to
all appearance, my studies and my desires, belonged to my purely
external vocation,<a href="#page_108_note_91"><sup>91</sup></a> and to
its external citizenlike relations; and by no means to mankind at large,
either regarded in itself or in its educational needs. Therefore this
idea of mine was in such violent contrast with my actual life that it
utterly surprised me. In fact, and perhaps greatly because of this
contrast, the idea would undoubtedly have been quite forgotten, had not
other circumstances occurred to revive it. On myself and on my life at
the time it seemed to have not the slightest effect, and it soon passed
from my memory. But later on in this same journey,<a
href="#page_108_note_92"><sup>92</sup></a> as I climbed down from the
Wartburg, and turned round to look at the castle, there rushed upon me
once more this thought of a higher educational vocation as my proper
life-work; and again, being so far removed from my actual external life,
it only flashed upon me with a momentary effulgence an instant, and then
sank. This, unconsciously to me, and therefore quite disregarded by me,
was the real position of my inner life when I arrived at the goal of my
journey, Frankfurt, from whence my life was so soon to develop so
largely. My energies at the moment were devoted towards attaining some
definite professional position for myself.<a
href="#page_108_note_93"><sup>93</sup></a> But in proportion as I began
to examine my profession more closely in its practical aspect, so did it
begin to prove insufficient of itself to satisfy me as the occupation of
my life. Then there came to me the definite purpose of living and
working at my profession rather to use it as a means to win some high
benefit for mankind.<a href="#page_108_note_94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p><a name="page_109"></a>The restlessness of youth, nay, that chance,
rather, which has always lovingly guided me, threw me unexpectedly into
relations with a man whose knowledge of mankind, and whose penetrating
glance into my inner being turned me at our very first interview from
the profession of an architect to that of a teacher and an educator, two
spheres of work which had, never previously occurred to me, still less
had appeared to me as the future objects of my life.<a
href="#page_109_note_95">95</a> But the very first time I found myself
before thirty or forty boys from nine to eleven years old, for that was
the class allotted to me to teach, I felt thoroughly at home. In fact, I
perceived that I had at last found my long-missed life element; and as I
wrote to my brother at the time, I was as well pleased as the fish in
the water, I was inexpressibly happy. Yet here from the very first
moment (and what a number of sacrifices had to be made, what a wealth of
activity was poured out!) I had to give information, advice, and
decisions on matters which hitherto I had not thought it necessary
seriously to consider, and so also here, in my new position, I soon came
to feel myself isolated, to stand alone.</p>

<p>I sought counsel where I had so often found it. I looked within
myself and to Nature for help. Here my plan of culture, hitherto
followed only for my own needs, came opportunely to my assistance. When
I was consulted by others, I looked to Nature for the answer, and let
Nature, life, spirit, and law speak for themselves through me; then the
answer was not merely satisfactory. No! its simple, unhesitating
confidence and youthful freshness gladdened and quickened the
inquirer.</p>

<p>This was all well enough when universal human interests were
concerned, but how about matters of instruction? I could, in fact,
fairly confess that in many respects I had no title to call myself a
cultured man, for hitherto all my culture had been fragmentary or
imaginative.</p>

<p>Once again I found myself in conflict with my environment; for I
could not possibly torture my scholars with what I myself had refused to
be tortured with&mdash;namely, the learning by heart of disconnected
rules. I was therefore compelled to strike out fresh <a
name="page_110"></a> paths for myself, which indeed my post rendered a
delightful task; because I not only had full liberty accorded me in this
matter, but was even urged onwards in that direction by my duty, since
the institution was a model school for the higher development of
teaching. My past self-culture, self-teaching, and self-development, and
my study of Nature and of life now stood me in good stead.</p>

<p>But this letter is not intended to contain the whole history of the
development of my mind; and I will therefore pass quickly forward, just
mentioning that from this time for six years onwards, during which I
thrice completely changed the conditions of my life,<a
href="#page_110_note_96"><sup>96</sup></a> I held most earnestly by this
same temper of mind and this same endeavour; and although I still always
lived in isolation as to my personal inner life, yet I was at many
points in full contact with the brisk mental effort and activity of that
stirring time (1805 to 1810), as regards teaching, philosophy, history,
politics, and natural science.<a
href="#page_110_note_97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>But the nobler, the more varied, the more animating was the life
surrounding me, and the more I found all without me, as also all within
me, striving and tending towards harmony and unity, by so much the less
could I longer be restrained from seeking out this unity, even should it
be at the sacrifice of all that was dear to me, if need were for that. I
was impelled to seek to develop this unity all bright and living within
my own soul, and to contemplate it in definite, clear, and independent
form, so that finally I might be able to set it forth in my actual life
with sureness and certainty.</p>

<p><a name="page_111"></a>After nine years' interval I visited the
university a second time; first (spring of 1810) at Göttingen, and then
a year and a half later (autumn of 1811) at Berlin.<a
href="#page_111_note_98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>I now began to pursue the study of languages. The linguistic
treasures which recent discoveries had brought us from Asia excited my
deepest interest wherever I came into contact with them.</p>

<p>But in general the means of acquiring languages were too lifeless,
too wanting in connection to be of any use to me; and the effort to work
them out afresh in my own way, soon led me to a renewed study of Nature.
Nature held me henceforth so fast that for years I was chained
uninterruptedly to her study, though truly languages went on as a
side-study during the time. Yet it was not as separate entities that I
considered the phenomena I was working at; rather was it as parts of the
great whole of natural life, and this also I regarded as reposing in one
supreme unity together with all mankind; Nature and man, the two
opposite mutually casting light upon each other and mirroring each
other.</p>

<p>After the German war of the spring of 1813 had interrupted my studies
at Berlin, and I had made acquaintance with a soldier's life, its need,
and its habits in Lützow's corps, I returned in 1814 to my studies and
to a scientific public post in Berlin. The care, the arrangement, and in
part the investigation and explanation of crystals were the duties of my
office. Thus I reached at last the central point of my life and
life-aim, where productiveness and law, life, nature, and mathematics
united all of them in the fixed crystalline form, where a world of
symbols offered itself to the <a name="page_112"></a> inner eye of the
mind; for I was appointed assistant to Weiss at the mineralogical museum
of the Berlin University.<a href="#page_112_note_99">99</a></p>

<p>For a long time it was my endeavour and my dearest wish to devote
myself entirely to an academical career, which then appeared to me as my
true vocation and the only solution of the riddle of my life; but the
opportunities I had of observing the natural history students of that
time, their very slight knowledge of their subject, their deficiency of
perceptive power, their still greater want of the true scientific
spirit, warned me back from this plan. On the other hand, the need of
man for a life worthy of his manhood and of his species pressed upon me
with all the more force, and, therefore, teaching and education again
asserted themselves vigorously as the chief subjects occupying my
thoughts. Consequently I was only able to keep my mind contented with
the duties of my post for two years; and, meanwhile, the stones in my
hand and under my eyes turned to living, speaking forms. The
crystal-world, in symbolic fashion, bare unimpeachable witness to me,
through its brilliant unvarying shapes, of life and of the laws of human
life, and spake to me with silent yet true and readable speech of the
real life of the world of mankind.</p>

<p>Leaving everything else, sacrificing everything else,<a
href="#page_112_note_100"><sup>100</sup></a> I was driven back upon the
education of man, driven also to my refuge in Nature, wherein as in a
mirror I saw reflected the laws of the development of being, which laws
I was now to turn to account for the education of my race. My task was
to educate man in <a name="page_113"></a> his true humanity, to educate
man in his absolute being, according to the universal laws of all
development.<a href="#page_113_note_101"><sup>101</sup></a> Therefore,
leaving Berlin, and laying down my office, I began late in the autumn of
1816 that educational work which, though it still takes its impulse from
me and exists under my leadership, yet in its deepest nature is
self-sufficient and self-conditioned.</p>

<p>Although I was not perhaps then capable of putting my convictions
into words, I at once realised this work in my own mind as comprehensive
and world-embracing in its nature, as an everlasting work to be evermore
performed for the benefit of the whole human race; yet I nevertheless
linked it, and for this very reason, to my own personal life; that is,
since I had no children of my own, I took to me my dear nephews whom I
most deeply loved, in order through them and with them to work out
blessings for my home and my native land, for Schwarzburg and Thuringia,
and so for the whole wide Fatherland itself.<a
href="#page_113_note_102"><sup>102</sup></a> The eternal <a
name="page_114"></a> principles of development, as I recognised them
within me, would have it thus and not otherwise.</p>

<p>Timidly, very timidly, did I venture to call my work by the title of
"German," or "Universal German" education; and, indeed, I struck that
out from one of my manuscripts, although it was precisely the name
required to start with as it expressed the broad nature of my proposed
institution. An appeal to the general public to become thorough <i>men</i>
seemed to me too grandiose, too liable to be misunderstood, as, indeed,
in the event, it only too truly proved; but to become thorough Germans,
so I thought, would seem to them something in earnest, something worth
the striving for, especially after such hard and special trials as had
recently been endured by the German nation.</p>

<p>With your penetrating judgment you quarrelled with that term "German
education;" but, after all, even the appeal to be made thorough Germans
proved to be too grandiose and liable to be misunderstood. For every one
said "German? Well, I <i>am</i> <a name="page_115"></a> German, and have
been so from my birth, just as a mushroom is a mushroom;<a
href="#page_115_note_103"><sup>103</sup></a> what, then, do I want with
education to teach me to be a thorough German?" What would these worthy
people have said, had I asked them to train themselves to become
thorough men? Now had I planned my educational institute altogether
differently, had I offered to train a special class, body-servants,
footmen or housemaids, shoemakers or tailors, tradesmen or merchants,
soldiers or even noblemen, then should I have gained fame and glory for
the great usefulness and practical nature of my institution, for
certain; and surely all men would have hastened to acknowledge it as an
important matter, and as a thing to be adequately supported by the
State. I should have been held as the right man in the right place by
the State and by the world; and so much the more because as a
State-machine I should have been engaged in cutting out and modelling
other State-machines. But I&mdash;I only wanted to train up free,
thinking, independent men! Now who wants to be, or who cares to suffer
another to be, a free-thinking, independent man? If it was folly to talk
about educating persons as Germans, what was it to talk about educating
them as men? The education of Germans was felt to be something
extraordinary and farfetched; the education of men was a mere shadow, a
deceitful image, a blind enthusiasm.<a
href="#page_115_note_104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>From this digression I now return, to continue my attempt at making
myself known to you, as far as is possible, in a letter; by which I mean
my real inner self, as manifested in my endeavours and my hopes.</p>

<p>Permit me, therefore, to go a step nearer towards what lies deepest
in my soul, at least that of it which is communicable to another person.
I have started by stating my position from the side of knowledge, now
let me state it also from another side. My experience, especially that
gained by repeated residences at the university, had taught me beyond a
doubt that the method of education hitherto in use, especially where it
involved learning by rote, and where it looked at subjects simply from
the outside <a name="page_116"></a> or historically, and considered
then capable of apprehension by mere exercise work, dulled the edge of
all high true attainment, of all real mental insight, of all genuine
progress in scientific culture, of self-contemplation, and thus of all
real knowledge, and of the acquisition of truth through knowledge. I
might almost go further, and say that its tendency was towards rendering
all these worthy objects impossible.</p>

<p>Therefore, I was firmly convinced, as of course I still am, that the
whole former educational system, even that which had received
improvement, ought to be exactly reversed, and regarded from a
diametrically opposite point of view&mdash;namely, that of a system of
development. I answered those who kept asking what it was that I really
did want after all, with this sentence: "I want the exact opposite of
what now serves as educational method and as teaching-system in
general." I was, and am, completely convinced, that after this fashion
alone genuine knowledge and absolute truth, by right the universal
possessions of mankind, shall find once again, not alone single students
here and there, but the vast majority of all our true-hearted young men
and of our professors spreading far and wide the elements of a noble
humanised life. To bring this into a practical scheme I held to be my
highest duty, a duty which I could never evade, and one which I could
never shake off, since a man cannot shake off his own nature.</p>

<p>Our greatest teachers, even Pestalozzi himself not excepted, seemed
to me too bare, too empirical,<a
href="#page_116_note_105"><sup>105</sup></a> and arbitrary, and
therefore <a name="page_117"></a> not sufficiently scientific in their
principles&mdash;that is, not sufficiently led by the laws of our being;
they seemed to me in no wise to recognise the Divine element in science,
to feel its worth, and to cherish it. Therefore I thought and hoped,
with the courage and inexperience of youth, that all scientific and
learned men, that the universities, in one word, would immediately
recognise the purport of my efforts, and would strive with all their
might to encourage me by word and deed.</p>

<p>In this I was egregiously mistaken; nevertheless I am not ashamed of
the error. But few persons raised their voices for me or against me;
and, indeed, your article in the <i>Isis</i> is the single sun-ray which
really generously warmed and enlightened my life and lifework. Enough!
the Universities paid no heed to the simple schoolmaster.<a
href="#page_117_note_106"><sup>106</sup></a> As to the "able editors,"
they, in their reviews, thought very differently from me; but why should
I trouble myself further with remembering their performances, which were
written simply with the object of degrading me and my work? They never
succeeded in shaking my convictions in the least.</p>

<p><a name="page_118"></a>I regard the simple course of development,
proceeding from analysis to synthesis, which characterises pure reasoned
thought, as also the natural course of the development of every human
being. Such a course of development, exactly opposite to the path taken
by the old-fashioned methods of education, I now see mankind about to
enter upon; nay, it has been actually entered upon already in a few
single cases, though these cases are almost unknown and therefore
unregarded; and with this new course of development a new period is to
begin, a new age for all mankind, and therefore in the higher inner
sense a new world; a world, perceiving and understanding, perceived and
understood; a world of crystal clearness, creating an altogether new
life for science, and carrying onward therefore the true science, that
is, the science of being, and all that is founded upon this and
conditioned by this.<a href="#page_118_note_107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

<p>I may image forth the position of my educational establishment with
regard to the universities, under the figure of family life.</p>

<p>In a healthily constituted family it is the mother who first cares
for, watches over, and develops the child, teaches him to "read, mark,
learn, and inwardly digest," deriving everything she teaches from its
central unity, and gathering up her teaching into that unity again.</p>

<p>The father receives his son from the hand and the heart of the <a
name="page_119"></a> mother; with his soul already full of true active
life, of desire for the knowledge of causes and effects, for the
understanding of the whole and its ramifications; with his mind open to
the truth and his eyes to the light, and with a perpetually nourished
yearning for creative activity, able to observe while building up, and
to recognise while taking apart; such in himself and his surroundings,
always active, creative, full of thought and endeavour, does the father
receive his son in his home, to train and teach him for the wider life
outside. Thus should it be with my educational institute and the
universities; as regards the growth and development of man I only desire
to take the place of the silently working, tenderly cherishing
mother.</p>

<p>The life, the will, the understanding, these three must form the
common chord or triad of the harmony of human life, now one tone, now
another, now two of the three, rising powerfully above the rest. But
where these tones are separate and inharmonious there they work to
discord, as we see but too clearly in daily life:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Wrestling with life and with death, suspended between them
we hang."</blockquote>

<p>In whatever family this chord is from the first set sweetly in tune,
its pure concords uniting to form the fundamental harmony of existence,
there all the hobgoblins of ordinary life, which even yet often unite to
annoy us, will be driven far away, there will joy and peace perpetually
inhabit, there will heaven descend to earth and earth rise up to heaven;
to a heaven, moreover, as full of contentment, as responsive to every
yearning of the soul as ever the Church has painted.</p>

<p>But since all true and earnest life must arise from and return to the
ideal life, to life in itself, so must a school of development, which is
to lead men, by means of their ordinary life, towards that higher life,
be itself a true school of religious training in the most comprehensive
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Man ought not to be contented with teaching merely directed to
satisfy his needs as a child of earth, but must demand and receive from
education a true foundation, a creative, satisfying preparation for all
the grades of development of nature and the world which mankind
encounters, and for the everlasting here <a name="page_120"></a> and
beyond of each new moment of existence, for the everlasting rest, the
everlasting activity, the everlasting life in God.</p>

<p>As, however, it is only as a Christian, be he consciously or
unconsciously so, baptised or unbaptised, taking the Christian name or
rejecting it, that he can think and act after this fashion, you can see
at once the reason why my system of education feels itself to be, and in
fact claims to be, an education after the true spirit, and following the
precepts of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Through love, mutual faith, and a common aim towards acquiring,
manifesting, and acting out knowledge, there has grown up round me a
little company of men bound together by beautiful human bonds, the like
of which you would with difficulty find elsewhere. In your last letter
you desired to have some account of these friends and members of my
household. I will describe them for you.</p>

<p>But if my account is to be anything more than a lifeless list of
names, and if, though it cannot be the closely-branched tree of life
which actually exists, it is at least to come as near it as a garland or
a nosegay to the tree, you must permit me to go back a little into my
past life; for out of the self-same spirit, whence arose my own
endeavours and which gave its direction to my own life, arose also the
circle of those friends who are now so closely united with me.</p>

<p>The German war of 1813, in which so much seed-corn was sowed that
perhaps only the smaller part of it has yet sprung up, to say nothing of
blossoming and fruitage, sowed also the seed whence sprang the first
beginnings of our association, and of our harmonious circle. In April
1813 Jahn led me and other Berlin students to meet my future comrades in
arms, Lützow's "Black Troop;" we went from Berlin to Dresden, and thence
for the most part to Leipzig. On this march Jahn made me acquainted
before we reached Meissen with another Berlin student, Heinrich
Langethal, of Erfurt, as a fellow-countryman of mine; and Langethal
introduced me to his friend and fellow-student in theology, Middendorff,
of Brechten, near Dortmund.<a
href="#page_120_note_108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>A wonderfully lovely spring evening spent together by the <a
name="page_121"></a> friendly shores of Elbe, and a visit to the
magnificent Cathedral of Meissen, brought me nearer to these and other
comrades; but it was the pleasant banks of Havel at Havelberg, the
charming situation of the grand cathedral, the "Rhine Travels" of Georg
Forster, a common love for nature, and above all a common eager yearning
for higher culture that bound us three for ever together.<a
href="#page_121_note_109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<p>The war in all its exhilaration and depression, its privation and
pleasure, its transient and its permanent aspects, flowed on; sometimes
nearer to us, sometimes further away. In August 1814 I was released from
service, and returned to Berlin, there to enter upon the post<a
href="#page_121_note_110"><sup>110</sup></a> at the University Museum,
which I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>Soon after, quite unexpectedly, I ran against my friends again, who
had come back to Berlin to finish their studies. After being somewhat
separated by the nature of our work, they as eagerly studying theology
as I did natural science, our common need and inner aspiration brought
us once more together. They had taken some private teaching, and were
frequently driven to seek my counsel and instruction by the difficulties
of their new position. When the war broke out afresh in 1815,
Middendorff had been living for several months previously with me as
room companion. Thus had life thrown us closely together, so that I
could see each one exactly as he was, in all his individuality, with his
qualities and his deficiencies, with what he could contribute, and what
he would have to receive from others.</p>

<p>In October 1816 I left my post, and quitted Berlin, without as yet
confiding to any one exactly what outward aim I had in view, simply
saying that I would write and give some account of myself as soon as I
had found what I set out to seek. In November of the same year my dearly
loved brother,<a href="#page_121_note_111"><sup>111</sup></a> the eldest
now living, whom I made my confidant so far as that was possible, and
who was at that time a manufacturer at Osterode in the Harz district,
gave me his two sons to educate. They were his only sons, though <a
name="page_122"></a> not his only children; two boys of six and eight
years old respectively. With these boys I set out for a village on the
Urn called Griesheim, and there I added to my little family, first two,
then a third, that is, altogether three other nephews, the orphan sons
of my late dearest brother,<a
href="#page_122_note_112"><sup>112</sup></a> he who had always best
sympathised with me through life. He had been minister at Griesheim, and
his widow still lived there. He had died of hospital fever in 1813, just
after the cessation of the war. I reckon, therefore, the duration of my
present educational work from November 16th, 1816.</p>

<p>Already I had written from Osterode to Middendorff at Berlin,
inviting him and Langethal to join me and help in working out a system
of life and education worthy of <i>man</i>. It was only possible for
Middendorff to reach me by April 1817, and Langethal could not arrive
until even the following September. The latter, however, sent me, by
Middendorff, his brother, a boy of eleven years old;<a
href="#page_122_note_113"><sup>113</sup></a> so that I now had six
pupils. In June of the same year (1817) family reasons caused me to move
from Griesheim to this place, Keilhau.<a
href="#page_122_note_114"><sup>114</sup></a> Next came other pupils
also, with Langethal's arrival in September. My household was growing
fast, and yet I had no house of my own. In a way only comprehensible to
Him Who knows the workings of the mind, I managed by November to get the
school that I now occupy built as a frame-house, but without being in
possession of the ground it stood on.</p>

<p>I pass over the space of a year, which was nevertheless so rich in
experiences of trouble and joy, of times when we were cast down, and
other times when we were lifted up, that its description would easily
fill many times the space even of this long letter. In June of the
following year I became in the most remarkable way possessor of the
little farm which I still hold, in Keilhau, and thus for the first time
possessor also of the land upon which the <a name="page_123"></a>
schoolhouse had already been erected.<a
href="#page_123_note_115"><sup>115</sup></a> As yet there were no other
buildings there.</p>

<p>In September 1818 I brought to the household, still further
increased, and now so rich with children and brothers, its <i>housewife</i>,
in the person of a lady whom a like love of Nature and of childhood with
my own, and a like high and earnest conception of education, as the
preparation for a life worthy of man, had drawn towards me. She was
accompanied by a young girl whom she had some time before adopted as a
daughter, and who now came with her to assist her in the duties of the
household.<a href="#page_123_note_116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<p>We had now a severe struggle for existence for the whole time up to
1820. With all our efforts we never could get the school house enlarged;
other still more necessary buildings had to be erected first, under
pressing need for them.<a href="#page_123_note_117"><sup>117</sup></a>
In the year 1820, <a name="page_124"></a> on Ascension Day, my brother
from Osterode, whose two sons were already my pupils, came to join me
with his whole family and all his possessions; urged by his love for his
boys, and a wish to help in the advancement of my life's purpose. As my
brother, beyond the two sons I have mentioned, had three daughters, my
family was increased by five persons through his arrival.<a
href="#page_124_note_118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>The completion of the school-house was now pushed on with zeal; but
it was 1822 before we got it finished. Our life from this point becomes
so complex that it is impossible to do more than just mention what
applies to the Association formed by our still united members.</p>

<p>In 1823, Middendorff's sister's son Barop, till then a divinity
student in Halle, visited us; and he was so impressed by the whole work
that he was irresistibly driven soon afterwards to join us in our
life-task.<a href="#page_124_note_119"><sup>119</sup></a> Since 1823,
with the exception of such breaks as his work in life demanded, he has
been uninterruptedly one of our community, sharing in our work. At this
moment<a href="#page_124_note_120"><sup>120</sup></a> he is in Berlin,
serving his one year with the colours as a volunteer, and devoting what
time he has to spare, to earnest study, especially that of natural
science. We hope to have him back with us next spring. In the autumn of
1825 Langethal became engaged to my wife's adopted daughter, who had
come with her from Berlin; and Middendorff became engaged to my
brother's eldest daughter. Ascension Day 1826 was the wedding-day for
both couples. Heaven blessed each marriage with a daughter, but took
back to itself the little one of Langethal.</p>

<p>Still another faithful colleague must I remember here, Herr Carl from
Hildburghausen, who has been since New Year's <a name="page_125"></a>
Day 1825 a member of our Institute, his particular work being to teach
instrumental music and singing. He lives and works in the true spirit of
the Institute, and is bound up heart and soul with its fortunes.<a
href="#page_125_note_121"><sup>121</sup></a> Of other teachers, who have
assisted us in the Institute for greater or less time, I need not speak;
they never properly belonged to our circle. Amongst all the specially
associated members of our little band, not one breach has occurred since
the beginning of our work. I would I could feel that I had accomplished
what I have aimed at in this letter&mdash;namely, to make you acquainted
with the inner deep seated common life which really binds together the
members composing our outwardly united association; although it has only
been feasible rather to suggest by implication the internal mental
phenomena of the external bonds of union than properly to indicate them
and to set them clearly forth.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="page_126"></a>This ends the autobiographical part of the
Krause letter. Here and there in the footnotes the present editors,
profound admirers of the great master, have ventured to criticise
frankly the inordinate belief in himself which was at once Froebel's
strength, and his weakness. On the one hand, his noble and truly
gigantic efforts were only made possible by his almost fanatical
conviction in his principles and in his mission. On the other hand, this
dogmatic attitude made it very difficult to work with him, for persons
of any independence of mind. He could scarcely brook discussion, never
contradiction. This is most characteristically shown by a fragment of
Froebel's dated 1st April, 1829, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I consider my own work and effort as <i>unique</i> in all time, as
<i>necessary</i> in itself, and as the <i>messenger of reformation</i> for all
ages, working forwards and backwards, offering and giving to mankind all
that it needs, and all that it perpetually seeks on every side. I have
no complaint to make if others think otherwise about it; I can bear with
them;<a href="#page_126_note_122"><sup>122</sup></a> I can even, if need
be, live with them, and this I have actually done; but I can share no
life-aim with them, they and I have no <i>unity</i> of purpose in life. It is
not I, it is they who are at fault herein; I do not separate myself from
them, they withdraw themselves from me."</p>

<p>To get a view of Froebel's work from the practical side, so as to
supplement the account we have received from Froebel himself as to the
origination and development of the principles upon which that work was
based, we have selected a sketch by Barop entitled "Critical Moments in
the Froebel Community;" written for Dr. Lange's edition by Barop (then
the principal and proprietor of Keilhau) about the year 1862.</p>





<center><h2><a name="page_127"></a>CRITICAL MOMENTS IN THE FROEBEL
COMMUNITY.</h2></center>

<hr width="20%">

<p>Under this heading Barop writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>About 1827 we were in an unusually critical position. You know how
little means we had when we began to create our Institution.<a
href="#page_127_note_123"><sup>123</sup></a> Middendorff had sacrificed
his entire inheritance from his father, but the purchase of the ground
and the erection of necessary buildings called for considerable sums, so
that Middendorff's addition to the capital had disappeared like drops of
water falling on a hot stone. My father-in-law, Christian Ludwig
Froebel, had later on come forward and placed his entire fortune
unconditionally in the hands of his brother,<a
href="#page_127_note_124"><sup>124</sup></a> but even this sacrifice was
not sufficient to keep away care and want from the door. My own father
was a man of means, but he was so angry at my joining the Froebel
community at Keilhau<a href="#page_127_note_125"><sup>125</sup></a> that
he refused me any assistance whatever. Mistrust surrounded us on all
sides in these early years of our work; open and concealed enmities
assailed us both from near and far, and sought to embitter our lot and
to nip our efforts in the bud. None the less for this, the institution
blossomed quick and fair; but later on, through the well-known
persecution directed against associations of students, it was brought to
the verge of ruin, for the spirit of 1815 was incarnate within it, and
it was this spirit which at the time (about 1827) was the object of the
extremest irritation.<a href="#page_127_note_126"><sup>126</sup></a> It
<a name="page_128"></a> would carry me too far were I to attempt to
give a complete account of these things. At times it really seemed as if
the devil himself must be let loose against us. The number of our pupils
sank to five or six, and as the small receipts dwindled more and more,
so did the burden of debt rise higher and higher till it reached a giddy
height. Creditors stormed at us from every side, urged on by lawyers who
imbrued their hands in our misery. Froebel would run out at the back
door and escape amongst the hills whenever dunning creditors appeared.
Middendorff, and he alone, generally succeeded in quieting them, a feat
which might seem incredible to all but those who have known the
fascination of Middendorff's address. Sometimes quite moving scenes
occurred, full of forbearance, trustfulness, and noble sentiment, on the
part of workmen who had come to ask us for their money. A locksmith, for
instance, was strongly advised by his lawyer to "bring an action against
the scamps," from whom no money was to be got, and who were evidently on
the point of failure. The locksmith indignantly repudiated the insult
thus levelled against us, and replied shortly that he had rather lose
his hard-earned money than hold a doubt as to our honourable conduct,
and that nothing was further from his thoughts than to increase our
troubles. Ah! and these troubles were hard to bear, for Middendorff had
already married, and I followed his example. When I proposed for my
wife, my future father-in-law and mother-in-law<a
href="#page_128_note_127"><sup>127</sup></a> said, "You surely will not
remain longer in Keilhau?" I answered, "Yes! I do intend to remain here.
The idea for which we live seems to me to be in harmony with the spirit
of the age, and also of deep importance in itself; and I have no doubt
but that men will come to believe in us because of our right
understanding of this idea, in the same way that we ourselves believe in
the invisible." As a matter of fact, none of us have ever swerved one
instant from the fullest belief in our educational mission, and the most
critical dilemma in the times we have <a name="page_129"></a> passed
through has never revealed one single wavering soul in this little
valley.</p>

<p>When our distress had risen to its highest pitch, a new and
unexpected prospect suddenly revealed itself.<a
href="#page_129_note_128"><sup>128</sup></a> Several very influential
friends of ours spoke to the Duke of Meiningen of our work. He summoned
Froebel to him, and made inquiries as to his plans for the future.
Froebel laid before him a plan for an educational institute,<a
href="#page_129_note_129"><sup>129</sup></a> complete in every
particular, which we had all worked at in common to draw up, in which
not only the ordinary "learned" branches of education but also
handicrafts, such as carpentering, weaving, bookbinding, tilling the
ground and so on were used as means of culture. During half the school
hours studies were to be pursued, and the other half was to be occupied
by handiwork of one kind or another. This work was to give opportunities
for direct instruction; and above all it was so planned as to excite in
the mind of the child a necessity for explanations as well as to gratify
his desire for creativeness and for practical usefulness. The awakening
of this eager desire for learning and creative activity, was one of the
fundamental thoughts of Friedrich Froebel's mind. The object-teaching of
Pestalozzi seemed to him not to go far enough; and he was always seeking
to regard man not only as a receptive being, but a creative, and
especially as a productive one. We never could work out our ideas in
Keilhau satisfactorily, because we could not procure efficient technical
teaching; and before all things we wanted the pupils themselves. But now
by the help of the Duke of Meiningen our keenest hopes seemed on the
point of gratification. The working out of the plan spoken of above, led
us to many practical constructions in which already lay the elements of
the future Kindergarten occupations. These models are now scattered far
and wide, and indeed are for the most part lost; but the written plan
has been preserved.</p>

<p>The Duke of Meiningen was much pleased with Froebel's explanations of
this plan, and with the complete and open-hearted <a
name="page_130"></a> way in which everything was laid before him. A
proposition was now made that Froebel should receive the estate of Helba
with thirty acres of land, and a yearly subsidy of 1,000 florins.<a
href="#page_130_note_130"><sup>130</sup></a> In passing it may be
noticed that Froebel was consulted by the duke as to the education of
the hereditary prince. Froebel at once said outright that no good would
be done for the future ruler if he were not brought up in the society of
other boys. The duke came to his opinion, and the prince was actually so
taught and brought up.</p>

<p>When Froebel came back from Meiningen<a
href="#page_130_note_131"><sup>131</sup></a> the whole community was
naturally overjoyed; but their joy did not last very long. A man of high
station in Meiningen who was accustomed to exercise a sort of
dictatorship in educational matters, as he was the right-hand man of the
prince in such things, a man also who had earned an honourable place in
literature (of which no one surely would seek to deprive him), feared
much lest the elevation of Froebel should injure his own influence. We
were therefore, all of a sudden, once again assailed with the meanest
and most detestable charges, to which our unfortunate position at
Keilhau lent a convenient handle. The duke received secret warnings
against us. He began to waver, and in a temporising way sent again to
Froebel, proposing that he should first try a provisional establishment
of twenty pupils as an experiment. Froebel saw the intention in the
duke's mind, and was thrown out of humour at once; for when he suspected
mistrust he lost all hope, and immediately cast from his mind what a few
hours before had so warmly encouraged him. Therefore Froebel at once
broke off all negotiations, and set out for Frankfurt, to discuss the
work at Keilhau with his friends; since after so many troubles he had
almost begun to lose faith in himself. Here by chance he met the
well-known musical composer Schnyder, from Wartensee. He told this
gentleman of the events which had just occurred, talked to him of his
plans and of our work at Keilhau, and exercised upon him that
overpowering influence which is the peculiar property of creative minds.
<a name="page_131"></a> Schnyder saw the value of his efforts, and
begged him to set up an educational establishment in his castle on the
Wartensee, in Switzerland.<a
href="#page_131_note_132"><sup>132</sup></a> Froebel hurriedly seized
with joy the hand thus held out to him, and at once set off for
Wartensee with his nephew, my brother-in-law Ferdinand.</p>

<p>There Friedrich and Ferdinand Froebel had already been living and
working some little time when I was asked by the rest of the community
who still remained at Keilhau to go and see for myself exactly how they
were getting on in Switzerland. With ten thalers<a
href="#page_131_note_133"><sup>133</sup></a> in my pocket, and in
possession of one old summer coat, which I wore, and a threadbare
frock-coat, which I carried over my arm, I set off on "Shanks's mare"<a
href="#page_131_note_134"><sup>134</sup></a> to travel the whole way. If
I were to go into details as to what I went through on that journey, I
should probably run the risk of being charged with gross exaggeration.
Enough, I got to my destination, and when I asked in the neighbourhood
about my friends and their doings, I learned from every one that there
was nothing further to say against "the heretics," than that they were
heretics. A few peasant children from the neighbourhood had found their
way to them, but no one came to them from any distance, as had been
reckoned upon from the first by Froebel as a source of income. The
ill-will of the clergy, which began to show itself immediately the
institution was founded, and which became stronger as the footing of our
friends grew firmer, was able to gather to itself a following sufficient
to check any quick growth of our undertaking. Besides, the basis for
such an establishment was not to be found at Wartensee. Schnyder had,
indeed, with a generosity never too greatly to be admired and praised,
made over to us his castle and all its furniture, his plate, his
splendid library,&mdash;in short, all that was in or around the castle
was fully at our disposition; but he would permit no new buildings or
alterations of any sort, and as the rooms assigned to us were in no way
suitable for our use, it was evident that his generous support must be
regarded as only a temporary and passing assistance. We perceived the
evil <a name="page_132"></a> of our situation in all its keenness, but
we saw no way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>In a most remarkable way there dawned upon us a new prospect at the
very moment when we least expected it. We were sitting one day in a
tavern near Wartensee, and talking of our struggles with some strangers
who happened to be there. Three travellers were much interested in our
narrative. They gave themselves out as business people from Willisau,<a
href="#page_132_note_135"><sup>135</sup></a> and soon informed us that
they had formed the notion of trying to get some assistance for us, and
our enterprise for their native town. This they actually did. We
received an invitation from twenty associated well-to-do families in
Willisau to remove our school there, and more fully to work out our
plans amongst them. The association had addressed the cantonal
authorities, and a sort of castle was allotted provisionally to us.
About forty pupils from the canton at once entered the school, and now
we seemed at last to have found what we had so long been seeking. But
the priests rose up furiously against us with a really devilish force.
We even went in fear of our lives, and were often warned by kind-hearted
people to turn back, when we were walking towards secluded spots, or had
struck along the outlying paths amongst the mountains. To what
abominable means this spirit of bigotry resorted, the following example
may serve to show.</p>

<p>In Willisau a church festival is held once a year, in which a
communion-wafer is shown, miraculously spotted with blood. The drops of
blood were believed by the people to have been evoked from the figure of
Jesus by the crime of two gamblers; who, having cursed Jesus, flung
their sword at him, whereupon the devil appeared. As "God be with us"<a
href="#page_132_note_136"><sup>136</sup></a> seized the villains by the
throat, a few drops of blood trickled from Jesus' wounds. To prevent
others, therefore, from falling in a like way into the power of the
arch-deceiver, a yearly commemorative festival is held at Willisau. The
wafer is shown as a warning to devout <a name="page_133"></a> people,
who flock in crowds from all parts of the neighbourhood to join in the
procession which closes the ceremony. We felt of course compelled to
attend, and as we wished to take our part, we offered to lead the
singing. I feared an outbreak, and I earnestly implored my friends to
keep quiet under any circumstances, and whatever happened, to give no
pretext for any excitement. Our singing was finished, when in the place
of the expected preacher, suddenly there appeared a blustering,
fanatical Capuchin monk. He exhausted himself in denunciations of this
God-forsaken, wicked generation, sketched in glaring colours the pains
of hell awaiting the accursed race, and then fell fiercely upon the
alarmed Willisauers, upbraiding them, as their worst sin, with the
fostering of heretics in their midst, the said "heretics" being
manifestly ourselves. Fiercer and fiercer grew his threats, coarser and
coarser his insults against us and our well-wishers, more and more
horrible his pictures of the flames of hell, into grave danger of which
the Willisauers, he said, had fallen by their awful sin. Froebel stood
as if benumbed, without moving a muscle, or changing a feature, exactly
in face of the Capuchin, in amongst the people; and we others also
looked straight before us, immovable. The parents of our pupils, as well
as the pupils themselves, and many others, had already fled midway in
the monk's Jeremiad. Every one expected the affair to end badly for us;
and our friends, outside the church, were taking precautions for our
safety, and concerting measures for seizing the monk who was thus
inciting the mob to riot. We stood quite still all the time in our
places listening patiently to the close of the Capuchin's tirade: "Win,
then, for yourselves an everlasting treasure in heaven." shouted he,
"bring this misery to an end, and suffer the wretched men to remain no
longer amongst you. Hunt the wolves from the land, to the glory of God
and the rage of the devil. Then will peace and blessing return, and
great joy in heaven with God, and on earth with those who heartily serve
Him and His saints. Amen." Hardly had he uttered the last word than he
disappeared through a side door and was no more seen. As for us, we
passed quietly through the staring and threatening mob. No hand was
raised against us at that moment, but danger lay about us on every side,
and it was no pleasure to recognise the fact that the sword of <a
name="page_134"></a> Damokles always hung by a hair over our head.
Feeling very uneasy at our insecure condition, I was sent, on the part
of the rest, to the authorities of the canton, especially to Abbe
Girard,<a href="#page_134_note_137"><sup>137</sup></a> and the mayor,
Eduard Pfyffer, to beg that they would provide for our safety with all
the means in their power. On my way I was recognised by a priest for one
of the newly-introduced "heretics" as I rested a moment in an inn. The
people there began to talk freely about me, and to cast looks of hatred
and contempt at me. At last, the priest waxing bolder and bolder,
accused me aloud of abominable heresy. I arose slowly, crossed with a
firm step over to the black-frocked one, and asked him, "Do you know,
sir, who Jesus Christ was, and do you hold Him in any particular
esteem?" Quite nonplussed by my firm and quiet address he stammered out,
"Certainly, He is God the Son, and we must all honour Him and believe on
Him, if we are to escape everlasting damnation." I continued, "Then
perhaps you can tell me whether Christ was a Catholic or a
Protestant?"</p>

<p>The black-frock was silenced, the crowd stared, and presently began
to applaud. The priest made off, and I was left in peace. My question
had answered better than a long speech.</p>

<p>In Eduard Pfyffer I found an estimable sterling man of humane and
firm character. He started from the fundamental principle that it was of
little use freeing the people from this or that special superstition,
but that we should do better by working for the future against sloth of
thought and want of independent mental character from the very
bottom&mdash;namely, by educating our young people. Therefore, he set
great store by our undertaking. And when I told him of our downcast
spirits and the absolute danger in which we lived at the moment, he
replied:&mdash;"There is only one way to ensure your safety. You must
win over the people. Work on a little longer, and then invite them all
from far and near to a public examination. If this test wins over the
crowd to your side, then, and only then, are you out of harm's reach." I
went home, and we followed this counsel. The examination was held on a
lovely day in autumn. A great crowd <a name="page_135"></a> from
several cantons flocked together, and there appeared delegates from the
authorities of Zürich, of Bern, and other cantons. Our contest with the
clerical party, which had been commented upon in most of the Swiss
journals, had drawn all eyes upon us. We scored a great victory with our
examination. The children developed so much enthusiasm, and answered so
readily, that all were agreeably surprised, and rewarded us with loud
applause. From seven in the morning till seven in the evening lasted
this examination, closing with games and gymnastic exercises performed
by the whole school. We rejoiced within ourselves; for our undertaking
might now be regarded as fairly floated. The institution was spoken of
in the great Council of the Canton, and most glowing speeches were
delivered in our favour by Herr Pfyffer, Herr Amrhyn, and others. The
Council decided that the castle and its outbuildings should be let to us
at a very cheap rate, and that the Capuchin who had openly incited to
riot against us should be expelled from the canton.</p>

<p>A little time after this examination a deputation from Bern came to
invite Froebel to undertake the organisation of an Orphanage at
Burgdorf. Froebel suggested that he should not be restricted to teach
orphans alone in the new establishment; his request was granted, and he
then accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>With this, it seemed to me, my mission in Switzerland was at an end,
and I began to long to return to Keilhau; my eldest son was now a year
old, and I had never yet seen him. Middendorff left his family, and
replaced me at Willisau, living there for four years far away from wife
and child.<a href="#page_135_note_138"><sup>138</sup></a> At Keilhau I
found things had improved, and the numbers had increased most
cheeringly. I determined to throw all my strength into the work of
raising the mother institution from her slough of debt. I began by a
piece of honourable swindling: and borrowed of Peter to pay Paul,
covering one debt with another, but at the same time making it appear
that we were paying our way. In this fashion our damaged credit was
restored, and as the receipts grew <a name="page_136"></a> happily
greater and greater, I began to gain ground. Eventually I was able to
send help to the other branches of our community, to increase my help as
time went on, and to prepare a place of refuge for them if anything went
wrong elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Switzerland our enterprise did not develop as rapidly as we
desired, in spite of the sanction of the Council of the Canton. The
institution at Willisau gained unlimited confidence there; but the
malevolent opposition of the clerical party secretly flourished as
before, and succeeded in depriving it of all aid from more distant
places. Under these circumstances we could not attain that prosperity
which so much activity and self-sacrificing work on the part of our
circle must otherwise infallibly have brought.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Froebel and Middendorff remained in Willisau. Froebel and
his wife went to Burgdorf, to found and direct the proposed Orphanage.<a
href="#page_136_note_139"><sup>139</sup></a> In his capacity as
Director, Froebel had to give what was called a Repetitive Course to the
teachers. In that Canton, namely, there was an excellent regulation
which gave three months' leave to the teachers once in every two
years.<a href="#page_136_note_140"><sup>140</sup></a> During this leave
they assembled at Burgdorf, mutually communicated their experiences, and
enriched their culture with various studies. Froebel had to preside over
the debates and to conduct the studies, which were pursued in common.
His own observations and the remarks of the teachers brought him anew to
the conviction that all school education was as yet without a proper
foundation, and, therefore, that until the education of the nursery was
reformed nothing solid and worthy could be attained. The necessity of
training gifted capable mothers occupied his soul, and the importance of
the education of childhood's earliest years became more evident to him
than ever. He determined to set forth fully his ideas on education,
which the tyranny of a thousand opposing circumstances had always
prevented him from working out in their completeness; or at all events
to do this as regards the earliest years of man, and then to win over
the world of women to the actual accomplishment of his plans.
Pestalozzi's "Mothers' Book" (<i>Buch der <a name="page_137"></a>
Mütter</i>) Froebel would replace by a complete theoretical and practical
system for the use of women in general. An external circumstance
supervened at this point to urge him onwards. His wife grew alarmingly
ill, and the physicians prescribed complete absence from the sharp Swiss
mountain air. Froebel asked to be permitted to resign his post, that he
might retire to Berlin. The Willisau Institution, although outwardly
flourishing, was limited more and more narrowly by the bigotry of the
priests, and must evidently now be soon given up, since the Government
had passed into the hands of the Jesuit party. Langethal and Ferdinand
Froebel were nominated Directors of Burgdorf.<a
href="#page_137_note_141"><sup>141</sup></a> Middendorff rejoined his
family at Keilhau. Later on, Langethal split off from the community and
accepted the direction of a girls' school in Bern (that school which,
after Langethal, the well-known Fröhlich conducted); but Froebel never
forgave him this step. Ferdinand Froebel remained, till his sudden and
early death, Director of the Orphanage at Burgdorf. A public funeral,
such as has never found its equal at Burgdorf, bore witness to the
amount of his great labours, and to the general appreciation of their
value.</p>

<p>When Friedrich Froebel came back from Berlin, the idea of an
institution for the education of little children had fully taken shape
in his mind. I took rooms for him in the neighbouring Blankenburg.<a
href="#page_137_note_142"><sup>142</sup></a> Long did he rack his brains
for a suitable name for his new scheme. Middendorff and I were one day
walking to Blankenburg with him over the Steiger Pass. He kept on
repeating, "Oh, if I could only think of a suitable name for my youngest
born!" Blankenburg lay at our feet, and he walked moodily towards it.
Suddenly he stood still as if fettered fast to the spot, and his eyes
assumed a wonderful, almost refulgent, brilliancy. Then he shouted to
the mountains so that it echoed to the four winds of heaven, "<i>Eurêka!</i>
I have it! K<small>INDERGARTEN</small> shall be the name of the new
Institution!"</p>





<p><a name="page_138"></a>Thus wrote Barop in or about the year 1862,
after he had seen all his friends pass away, and had himself become
prosperous and the recipient of many honours. The University of Jena
made him a doctor, and the Prince of Rudolstadt created him his Minister
of Education. Froebel slept in Liebenstein, and Middendorff at the foot
of the Kirschberg in Keilhau. They sowed and reaped not; and yet to
possess the privilege of sowing, was it not equivalent in itself to
reaping a very great reward? In any event, it is delightful to remember
that Froebel, in the April of 1852, the year in which he died (June
21st), received public honours at the hands of the general congress of
teachers held in Gotha. When he appeared that large assembly rose to
greet him as one man; and Middendorff, too, who was inseparable from
Froebel, so that when one appeared the other was not far off, had before
his death (in 1853) the joy of hearing a similar congress at Salzungen
declare the system of Froebel to be of world-wide importance, and to
merit on that account their especial consideration and their most
earnest examination.</p>

<p>A few words on Middendorff, culled from Lange's account, may be
serviceable. Middendorff was to Froebel as Aaron was to Moses. Froebel,
in truth, was "slow of speech and of a slow tongue" (Exod. iv. 10), and
Middendorff was "his spokesman unto the people" (v. 16). It was the
latter's clearness and readiness of speech which won adherents for
Froebel amongst people who neither knew him nor could understand him. In
1849 Middendorff had immense success in Hamburg; but when Froebel came,
later on, to occupy the ground thus conquered beforehand, he had to
contend against much opposition, for every one missed the easy eloquence
of Middendorff, which had been so convincing. Dr. Wichard Lange came to
know Froebel when the latter visited Hamburg in the winter of 1849-50.
At this time he spent almost every afternoon and evening with him, and
held the post of editor of Froebel's <i>Weekly Journal</i>. Even after this
close association with Froebel, he found himself unable thoroughly to go
with <a name="page_139"></a> the schemes for the education of little
children, the Kindergarten, and with those for the training of
Kindergarten teachers. "Never mind!" said Froebel, out of humour, when
Lange told him this; "if you cannot come over to my views now, you will
do so in ten years' time; but sooner or later, <i>come you must</i>!" Dr.
Lange nobly fulfilled the prophecy, and the edition of Froebel's
collected works (Berlin 1862), from which we derive the present text
(and much of the notes), was his gift of repentance to appease the wrath
of the Manes of his departed friend and master. Nor was he content with
this; but by his frequent communications to <i>The Educational Journal</i>
(<i>Die Rheinischen Blätter</i>), originally founded by Diesterweg, and by
the Froebelian spirit which he was able to infuse into the large
boys'-school which he long conducted at Hamburg, he worked for the "new
education" so powerfully and so unweariedly that he must be always
thankfully regarded as one of the principal adherents of the great
teacher. His connection with the Froebel community was further
strengthened by a most happy marriage with the daughter of
Middendorff.</p>

uncle Friedrich to begin his educational work in Griesheim in 1816. (3)
Christian Ludwig, first a manufacturer in Osterode, and then associated
with Friedrich from 1820 onwards,&mdash;born 24th June, 1770, died 9th
January, 1851. (4) Traugott, who studied medicine at Jena, became a
medical man, and was burgomaster of Stadt-Ilm. Friedrich August Wilhelm
himself was born on the 21st April, 1782, and died on the 21st June,
1852. He had no sisters.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_004_note_3"></a><a href="#page_004">Footnote

Edinburgh.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_005_note_4"></a><a href="#page_005">Footnote
4</a>: This needs explanation. In Germany, even by strangers, children
are universally addressed in the second person singular, which carries
with it a certain caressing sentiment. Grown persons would be addressed
(except by members of their own family, or intimate friends) in the
third person plural. Thus, if one met a child in the street, one might
say, <i>Willst Du mit mir kommen</i>? (Wilt thou come with me?); whereas to a
grown person the proper form would be, <i>Wollen Sie mit mir kommen</i>?
(Will THEY&mdash;meaning, will YOU&mdash;come with me?). The mode of
speech of which Froebel speaks here is now almost obsolete, and even in
his day was only used to a person of markedly inferior position. Our
sentence would run in this case, <i>Will Er mit mir kommen</i>? (Will
HE&mdash;meaning, will YOU, John or Thomas&mdash;come with me?), and
carries with it a sort of contemptuous superciliousness, as if the
person spoken to were beneath the dignity of a direct address. It is
evident, therefore, that to a sensitive, self-torturing child like
Froebel, being addressed in this manner would cause the keenest pain;
since, as he justly says, it has the effect, by the mere form of speech,
of <i>isolating</i> the person addressed. Such a one is not to be considered
as of our family, or even of our rank in life.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_013_note_9"></a><a href="#page_013">Footnote

(1827), and seeking thereby to enlist the Duke of Meiningen's sympathies
in his work, in order to found a fresh institution at Helba, he was
undergoing what was almost a persecution at Keilhau. All associations of
progressive men were frowned upon as politically dangerous, and Keilhau,
amongst the rest, was held in suspicion. Somewhat of this is seen in the
interesting account by Barop further on ("Critical Moments at
Keilhau").</small></p>

professor at the university since 1789, had published in 1787-8 his
"Anleitung zur Kentniss und Geschichte der Pflanzen," 2 vols. We have
not seen this work. Batsch also published an "Introduction to the Study
of Natural History," which reached a second edition in 1805.</small></p>

astray.</small></p>

said in a <a href="#page_003_note_2">footnote on p. 3</a>, August was
the eldest brother of Friedrich, and Christoph was the eldest then
living. Traugott, who was at Jena with Friedrich, was his next older

words were written in 1827. The "Menschen Erziehung" of Froebel
("Education of Man"), which appeared the year before, had also touched
upon the subject. It was further developed in his "Mutter und
Koselieder" ("Mother's Songs and Games"), in which his first wife
assisted him. That appeared in 1838. In the same year was also founded
the <i>Sonntags-Blatt</i> (<i>Sunday Journal</i>), to which many essays and
articles on this subject were contributed by Froebel. The third volume
("Pädagogik") of Dr. Wichard Lange's complete edition of Froebel's works
is largely made up of these <i>Sonntags-Blatt</i> articles. The whole
Kindergarten system rests mainly on this higher view of children's
play.</small></p>

(his "native land"), an institution like that of Pestalozzi at Yverdon;
and he sought to interest the Princess Regent of Rudolstadt by the full
account of Yverdon already mentioned.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_080_note_70"></a><a href="#page_080">Footnote
70</a>: This would scarcely seem probable to those who admire and love
Pestalozzi. But we must remember that religious teaching appeals so
intimately to individual sympathies that it is quite possible that what
was of vital service to many others was not of so much use to Froebel,
who was, as he frankly admits, out of harmony on many points with his
noble-hearted teacher.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_082_note_71"></a><a href="#page_082">Footnote

Froebel. Observations of its path have led to a belief that it has a
period of 300 years; so that it was possibly seen by our ancestors in
1511, and may be seen by our remote descendants in 2111. The appearance
of this comet was synchronous with an unusually fine vintage harvest,
and "wine of the great Comet year" was long held in great esteem.</small></p>

Pestalozzi.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_090_note_77"></a><a href="#page_090">Footnote
77</a>: Froebel is here symbolically expressing the longing which
pervaded all noble spirits at that time for a free and united Germany,
for a great Fatherland. The tender mother's love was symbolised by the
ties of home (Motherland), but the father's strength and power
(Fatherland) was only then to be found in German national life in the
one or two large states like Prussia, etc. It needed long years and the
termination of this period of preparation by two great wars, those of
1866 and of 1870, to bind the whole people together, and make Germany no
longer a "geographical expression" but a mighty nation.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_090_note_78"></a><a href="#page_090">Footnote

declared war against the common enemy and oppressor, Napoleon. The other
German powers, for the most part, held aloof.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_091_note_79"></a><a href="#page_091">Footnote
79</a>: The Baron von Lützow formed his famous volunteer corps in March
1813. His instructions were to harass the enemy by constant skirmishes,
and to encourage the smaller German states to rise against the tyrant
Napoleon. The corps became celebrated for swift, dashing exploits in
small bodies. Froebel seems to have been with the main body, and to have
seen little of the more active doings of his regiment. Their favourite
title was "Lützow's Wilde Verwegene Schaar" (Lützow's Wild Bold Troop).
Amongst the volunteers were many distinguished men; for instance, the
poet Körner, whose volume of war poetry, much of it written during the
campaign, is still a great favourite. One of the poems, "Lützow's Wilde
Jagd" ("Lützow's Wild Chase"), is of world-wide fame through the musical
setting of the great composer Weber. In June 1813 came the armistice of
which Froebel presently speaks. During the fresh outbreak of war after
the armistice the corps was cut to pieces. It was reorganised, and we
find it on the Rhine in December of the same year. It was finally
dissolved after Napoleon's abdication and exile to Elba, 20th April, and
the peace of Paris 30th May, 1814.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_092_note_80"></a><a href="#page_092">Footnote
80</a>: <i>Die Grafschaft Mark.</i> The Mark of Brandenburg (so called as
being the mark or frontier against Slavic heathendom in that direction
during the dark ages) is the kernel of the Prussian monarchy. It was in
the character of Markgraf of Brandenburg, that the Hohenzollern princes
were electors of the German Empire; their title as king was due not to
Brandenburg, but to the dukedom of Prussia in the far east (once the
territory of the Teutonic military order), which was elevated to the
rank of an independent kingdom in 1701. The title of the present Emperor
of Germany still begins "William, Emperor of Germany, King of Prussia.
Markgraf of Brandenburg," etc., etc., showing the importance attached to
this most ancient dignity. The Mark of Brandenburg contains Berlin.
Middendorff seems to have been then living in the Mark. Froebel cannot
have forgotten that by origin Wilhelm Middendorff was a
Westphalian.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_093_note_81"></a><a href="#page_093">Footnote
81</a>: Of Bauer little further is to be known. He was afterwards
professor in the Frederick-William Gymnasium (Grammar School) in Berlin,
but has no further connection with Froebel's career. On the other hand,
a few words on Langethal and Middendorff seem necessary here. Heinrich
Langethal was born in Erfurt, September 3rd, 1792. He joined Froebel at
Keilhau in 1817. He was a faithful colleague of Froebel's there, and at
Willisau and Burgdorf, but finally left him at the last place, and
undertook the management of a girls' school at Bern. He afterwards
became a minister in Schleusingen, returning eventually to Keilhau. One
of the present writers saw him there in 1871. He was then quite blind,
but happy and vigorous, though in his eightieth year. He died in 1883.
Wilhelm Middendorff, the closest and truest friend Froebel ever had,
without whom, indeed, he could not exist, because each formed the
complement of the other's nature, was born at Brechten, near Dortmund,
in Westphalia, September 20th, 1793, and died at Keilhau November 27th,
1853, a little over a year after his great master. (Froebel had passed
away at Marienthal July 21st, 1852.)</small></p>

book, accompanied his father, the naturalist, in Captain Cook's journey
round the world. He then settled in Warrington (England) in 1767; taught
languages, and translated many foreign books into English, etc. He left
England in 1777, and served many princes on the Continent as librarian,
historiographer, etc., amongst others the Czarina Catherine. He was
librarian to the Elector of Mainz when the French Revolution broke out,
and was sent as a deputation to Paris by the republicans of that town,
who desired union with France. He died at Paris in 1794. His prose is
considered classical in Germany, having the lightness of French and the
power of English gained through his large knowledge of those
literatures.</small></p>

more fully. He speaks of "die Betrachtung des Zahlensinnes in
horizontaler oder Seiten-Richtung," and one would be glad of further
details of this view of number. We think that the full expression of the
thought here shadowed out, is to be found in the Kindergarten
occupations of mat-weaving, stick-laying, etc., in their arithmetical
aspect. Certainly in these occupations, instead of number being built up
as with bricks, etc., it is laid along horizontally.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_102_note_86"></a><a href="#page_102">Footnote

at Rohlsbach, in Swabia, 1st August, 1779. (His real name was
Ockenfuss.) In 1812 Oken was appointed ordinary professor of natural
history at Jena, and in 1816 he founded his celebrated journal, the
<i>Isis</i>, devoted chiefly to science, but also admitting comments on
political matters. The latter having given offence to the Court of
Weimar, Oken was called upon either to resign his professorship or
suppress the <i>Isis</i>. He chose the former alternative, sent in his
resignation, transferred the publication of the <i>Isis</i> to Rudolstadt,
and remained at Jena as a private teacher of science. In 1821 he
broached in the <i>Isis</i> the idea of an annual gathering of German
<i>savants</i>, and it was carried out successfully at Leipzig in the
following year. To Oken, therefore, may be indirectly ascribed the
genesis of the annual scientific gatherings common on the Continent, as
well as of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which
at the outset was avowedly organised after his model. He died in
1851.</small></p>

In Oberweissbach he was set down as "moonstruck." All this is more fully

<p><small><a name="page_110_note_97"></a><a href="#page_110">Footnote
97</a>: Froebel was driven to Yverdon by the perusal of some of
Pestalozzi's works which Gruner had lent him. He stayed with Pestalozzi
for a fortnight, and returned with the resolve to study further with the
great Swiss reformer at some future time. In 1807, he became tutor to
Herr von Holzhausen's somewhat spoilt boys, demanded to have the entire
control of them, and for this object their isolation from their family.
The grateful parents, with whom Froebel was very warmly intimate, always
kept the rooms in which he dwelt with his pupils exactly as they were at
that time, in remembrance of his remarkable success with these boys.
Madame von Holzhausen had extraordinary influence with Froebel, and he
continued in constant correspondence with her. In 1808 Froebel and his
pupils went to Yverdon, and remained till 1810. But the philosophic
groundwork of Pestalozzi's system failed to satisfy him. Pestalozzi's
work started from the external needs of the poorest people, while
Froebel desired to found the columns supporting human culture upon
theoretically reasoned grounds and upon the natural sciences. A
remarkable difference existed between the characters of the two great
men. Pestalozzi was diffident, acknowledged freely his mistakes, and
sometimes blamed himself for them bitterly; Froebel never thought
himself in the wrong, if anything went amiss always found some external
cause for the failure, and in self-confidence sometimes reached an
extravagant pitch.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_111_note_98"></a><a href="#page_111">Footnote
98</a>: Either Froebel or his editor has made a blunder here. Froebel
went to Göttingen in July 1811 (see <a href="#page_084">p. 84</a>), and
to Berlin in October 1812 (see <a href="#page_089">p.

99</a>: At this time, however, the symbols of the inorganic world did
not appeal to Froebel with the same force as those of the organic world.
In a letter to Madame von Holzhausen. 31st March, 1831, he writes: "It
is the highest privilege of natural forms or of natural life that they
contain agreement and perfection within themselves as a whole class,
while differing and filled with imperfection in particular individuals;
for look at the loveliest blooming fruit-tree, the sweetest rose, the
purest lily, and your eye can always detect deficiencies, imperfections,
differences in each one, regarded as a single phenomenon, a separate
bloom; and, further, the same want of perfection appears also in every
single petal: on the other hand, wherever mathematical symmetry and
precise agreement are found, <i>there is death</i>".</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_112_note_100"></a><a href="#page_112">Footnote

<p><small><a name="page_113_note_102"></a><a href="#page_113">Footnote
102</a>: Froebel travelled from Berlin to Osterode, and took with him
both his brother Christian's sons, Ferdinand and Wilhelm, to Griesheim;
there to educate them together with the three orphans of his brother
Christoph, who had died in 1813, of hospital fever, whilst nursing the
French soldiers. Of the sons of Christian, Ferdinand studied philosophy,
and at his death was director of the Orphanage founded by Froebel in
Burgdorf; Wilhelm, who showed great talent, and was his uncle's
favourite nephew, died early through the consequences of an accident,
just after receiving his "leaving certificate" from the gymnasium of
Rudolstadt.</small></p>

<p><small>As regards the sons of Christoph, they were the immediate
cause of Froebel's going to Griesheim, for their widowed mother sent for
her brother-in-law to consult him as to their education. Julius, the
eldest, was well prepared in Keilhau for the active life he was
afterwards destined to live. He went from school to Munich, first, to
study the natural sciences; and while yet at the university several
publications from his pen were issued by Cotta. Later on he took an
official post in Weimar, and continued to write from time to time.
Meanwhile he completed his studies in Jena and Berlin under Karl von
Ritter, the great authority on cosmography, and under the distinguished
naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt. In 1833 he became Professor at the
Polytechnic School in Zurich; but his literary avocations eventually
drew him to Dresden. Here he was chosen Deputy to the National Assembly
at Frankfurt in 1848. After the dissolution of that Assembly, Julius
Froebel, in common with many others of the more advanced party, was
condemned to death. He escaped to Switzerland before arrest, and fled to
New York. In after life he was permitted to return to Germany, and
eventually he was appointed Consul at Smyrna.</small></p>

<p><small>Karl Froebel, the next son, went to Jena also. He then took a
tutorship in England, and it was at this time (1831) that his pamphlet,
"A Preparation for Euclid," appeared. He returned to the Continent to
become Director of the Public Schools at Zürich. He left Zürich in 1848
for Hamburg, where he founded a Lyceum for Young Ladies. Some years
later, when this had ceased to exist, he went again to England, and
eventually founded an excellent school at Edinburgh with the aid of his
wife; which, indeed, his wife and he still conduct. His daughters show
great talent for music, and one of them was a pupil of the distinguished
pianist, Madame Schumann (widow of the great composer).</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_115_note_103"></a><a href="#page_115">Footnote
103</a>: Or, as we say, A is A.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_115_note_104"></a><a href="#page_115">Footnote
104</a>: A great deal of Froebel's irony might all too truly be still
applied to current educational work.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_116_note_105"></a><a href="#page_116">Footnote
105</a>: Empiricism&mdash;that is, <i>a posteriori</i> investigations, based
on actual facts and not <i>a priori</i> deductions from theories, or general
laws, did good service before Froebel's time, and will do good service
yet, Froebel notwithstanding. In Froebel's time the limits Kant so truly
set to the human understanding were overstepped on every side; Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel were teaching, and the latter especially had an
overpowering influence upon all science. Every one constructed a
philosophy of the universe out of his own brain. Krause, the recipient
of this letter, never attained to very great influence, though had he
been in Hegel's chair he might perhaps have wielded Hegel's authority,
and there was for a long time a great likelihood of his appointment.
Meanwhile he reconstructed the university at Göttingen. Even practical
students of Nature, such as Oken, did homage to the general tendency
which had absorbed all the eager spirits of the vanguard of human
advancement, amongst them Froebel himself. We see how firmly set Froebel
was against experience-teaching, <i>a posteriori</i> work, or, as he calls
it, empiricism. The Kantist, Arthur Schopenhauer, was not listened to,
and dwelt apart, devouring his heart in bitter silence; breaking out at
last with the dreary creed of Pessimism.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_117_note_106"></a><a href="#page_117">Footnote
106</a>: Froebel is here hardly fair. How should people know much of him
as yet? He had at this time written the following works:&mdash;(1) "On
the Universal German Educational Institute of Rudolstadt" (1822); (2)
"Continuation of the Account of the Universal German Educational
Institute at Keilhau" (1823); (3) "Christmas at Keilhau: a Christmas
Gift to the Parents of the Pupils at Keilhau, to the Friends and the
Members of the Institute" (1824); (4) "The Menschen Erziehung," the full
title of which was "The Education of Man: The Art of Education,
Instruction, and Teaching, as attempted to be realised at the Universal
Educational Institute at Keilhau, set forth by the Originator, Founder,
and Principal of the Institute, Friedrich Froebel" (1826), never
completed; (5) <i>Family Weekly Journal of Education for Self-culture and
the Training of Others</i>, edited by Friedrich Froebel, Leipzig and
Keilhau. But Froebel, in his unbusiness-like way, published all these
productions privately. They came out of course under every disadvantage,
and could only reach the hands of learned persons, and those to whom
they were really of interest, by the merest chance. Further, Froebel, as
has already abundantly appeared, was but a poor author. His stiff,
turgid style makes his works in many places most difficult to
understand, as the present translators have found to their cost, and he
was therefore practically unreadable to the general public. In his usual
self-absorbed fashion, he did not perceive these deficiencies of his,
nor could he be got to see the folly of private publication. Indeed, on
the contrary, he dreamed of fabulous sums which one day he was to
realise by the sale of his works. It is needless to add that the event
proved very much the reverse. As to criticism, it was particularly the
"able editor" Harnisch who pulled to pieces the "Menschen Erziehung" so
pitilessly on its appearance, and who is probably here referred
to.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_118_note_107"></a><a href="#page_118">Footnote
107</a>: This passage may serve as a sufficient illustration of
Froebel's metaphysical way of looking at his subject. It is scarcely our
habit at the present day to regard the science of being (ontology) as a
science at all, since it is utterly incapable of verification; but it is
not difficult to trace the important truth really held by Froebel even
through the somewhat perplexing folds of scholastic philosophy in which
he has clothed it.</small></p>

to her orphaned children." The widow understood this in quite a special
and peculiar sense, whereof Froebel had not the remotest idea. Later on,
when she came to know that Froebel was engaged to another lady, she made
over to him the Keilhau farm, and herself went to live at
Volkstädt.]</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_123_note_116"></a><a href="#page_123">Footnote
116</a>: This young girl, the adopted daughter of the first Madame
Froebel, was named Ernestine Chrispine, and afterwards married
Langethal. Froebel's first wife, Henrietta Wilhelmine Hoffmeister, was
born at Berlin 20th September, 1780, and was therefore thirty-eight at
the time of her marriage. She was a remarkable woman, highly cultured, a
pupil of Schleiermacher and of Fichte. Before her marriage with Froebel
she had been married to an official in the War Office, and had been
separated from him on account of his misconduct. Middendorff and
Langethal knew the family well, and had frequently spoken with Froebel
about this lady, who was admired and respected by both of them. Froebel
saw her once in the mineralogical museum at Berlin, and was wonderfully
struck by her, especially because of the readiness in which she entered
into his educational ideas. When afterwards he desired to marry, he
wrote to the lady and invited her to give up her life to the furtherance
of those ideas with which she had once shown herself to be so deeply
penetrated, and to become his wife. She received his proposal
favourably, but her father, an old War Office official, at first made
objections. Eventually she left her comfortable home to plunge amidst
the privations and hardships of all kinds abundantly connected with
educational struggles. She soon rose to great honour with all the little
circle, and was deeply loved and most tenderly treated by Froebel
himself. In her willingness to make sacrifices and her cheerfulness
under privations, she set them all an example. She died at Blankenburg
in May 1839.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_123_note_117"></a><a href="#page_123">Footnote

harder.</small></p>

<p><small><a name="page_124_note_118"></a><a href="#page_124">Footnote
118</a>: Christian had already assisted his brother at Griesheim, and
before that, to the utmost of his power. The three daughters were (1)
Albertine, born 29th December, 1801, afterwards married Middendorff; (2)
Emilie, born 11th July, 1804, married Barop, died 18th August, 1860, at
Keilhau; (3) Elise, born 5th January, 1814, married Dr. Siegfried
Schaffner, one of the Keilhau colleagues, later on.</small></p>

126</a>: The long turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, the outcome of the
French Revolution, ceased in 1815; and the minds of the students and the
other youths of the country, set free from this terrible struggle for
liberty, turned towards the reformation of their own country. Many
associations were formed: perhaps here and there wild talk was indulged
in. The Government grew alarmed, and though the students had invariably
acted with perfect legality, all their associations were dispersed and
forbidden.</small></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
